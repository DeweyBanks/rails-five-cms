<!--more--></span>

Common types of meditation include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Concentrative meditation</strong>: With this type of meditation, the objective is to observe a single object such as an image, sound or one’s own breathing. Certain types of concentrative meditation (e.g., Transcendental Meditation) involve the focus on a <i>mantra</i> — a word or a sound that is repeated in order to help the individual reach a trancelike state.</li>
 	<li><strong>Open awareness meditation</strong>: This form of meditation allows the individual’s mind to become aware of thoughts and feelings as they naturally occur without specifically focusing on an object or topic.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mindfulness meditation</strong>: Mindfulness meditation is the most common type of meditation practiced in Western culture. It is similar to concentrative meditation as the individual focuses on an object, sound, breathing, bodily sensations, thoughts or feelings. However, the individual is simultaneously attentive to his or her surroundings.</li>
 	<li><strong>Guided meditation</strong>: Guided meditation is the process in which an individual is guided through the meditation process by another person (e.g., a physician, mental health professional or a master of one of the schools of meditation).</li>
</ul>
It is generally recommended that individuals who are practicing meditation perform at least one session of 15 to 20 minutes each day. Some people prefer longer sessions of 30 to 60 minutes, while others may reserve an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening. Although longer meditation sessions offer greater benefits, a slower start may help individuals to maintain the practice over the long term.","About Meditation","Learn about meditating.","publish","open","open","","about-meditation","","","2017-07-20 16:20:31","2017-07-20 16:20:31","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/about-meditation/",0,"post","",0
1397,1,"2016-09-07 19:14:05","2016-09-07 19:14:05","While \"sodium\" and \"salt\" are often used interchangeably, they are, in fact, different substances. Both are minerals, and salt is a mineral that is made up of 40 percent sodium and 60 percent chloride. One teaspoon of salt contains approximately 2,300 mg of sodium.

The body cannot produce sodium on its own, so it must be obtained through the consumption of foods and beverages. According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/salt/food.htm\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, most (77 percent) of the sodium that individuals consume is contained in processed foods and meals eaten in restaurants; 12 percent naturally occurs in foods and beverages; 6 percent is added at the table; and 5 percent is added while cooking at home.

Examples of processed foods that are high in sodium include: canned soups, canned vegetables, salad dressings, soy sauce, pasta, pasta sauces, bread, breakfast cereals, deli meats, pizza, frozen meals, some meats and poultry, cheese, and snacks such as potato chips and pretzels.

Sodium in and of itself is not harmful. Without it, the body would not be able to maintain adequate water and mineral balance, the absorption of major nutrients would be impaired, and nerves and muscles would cease to function. The danger occurs when individuals consume excessive amounts of sodium.","Are Sodium And Salt The Same?","Distinguishing between salt and sodium","publish","open","open","","are_sodium_and_salt_the_same","","","2017-07-20 20:52:51","2017-07-20 20:52:51","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/are_sodium_and_salt_the_same/",0,"post","",0
1398,1,"2016-03-15 19:14:07","2016-03-15 19:14:07","The causes of anxiety disorders are not fully known, however, scientists believe that they are most likely the result of a combination of factors including changes in the brain, environmental stress, genetics, and psychological and developmental factors.

Anxiety can also manifest due to medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism, heart failure or COPD, and the use of certain medications or drugs such as corticosteroids, cocaine, amphetamines, and excessive amounts of caffeine.

Since the causes are varied in nature, but the end result (that of anxiousness) is still the same, the only way to treat anxiety disorders—without medication—appears to be to discover a pattern for symptoms and to try and then isolate triggers. This allows an individual to at the very least avoid a possible anxious situation. But avoidance is only half of the answer.

While an anxiety disorder may not have a cure to the extent that the person afflicted will never have to go through extreme anxiety, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t a way to satisfactorily overcome the disorder. Once an individual knows what causes the anxiety to flare up they can preempt the negative experience by modifying their attitude and behavior going in to the situation as opposed to just reacting to it. For example, if a cramped space like a subway car or an elevator causes you anxiety, embrace the time spent in this triggering space by normalizing the area. This can be achieved by being mindful of your breathing, speaking to a stranger with a prepared, friendly greeting, or opening up your posture and putting a smile on your face to invite positivity. In the end mindfulness is key to overcoming social anxiety.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
Social anxiety in an age of virtual worlds, ever distancing relationships, and instant gratification is becoming a big problem. Because anxiety disorders cause extreme discomfort in the individual, escapism is one of the easiest solutions to employ—particularly because one can escape by simply taking out their phone. But the only way to overcome anxiety is to face it with the knowledge of one’s self. The mind is malleable and, if you suffer from an anxiety disorder, this fact along with the idea that the avoidance of anxiety inducing situations can only take you so far should help motivate you to kick anxiety to the curb.

1399,1,"2016-02-10 19:14:10","2016-02-10 19:14:10","The benefits of regular physical activity are enormous. In addition to weight management, stress relief and an improved sense of well–being, the performance of regular physical exercise reduces the risk of many diseases and conditions, improves the overall quality of one’s life and helps maintain the functional independence of older adults.

According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, people who are physically active for approximately 7 hours per week have a 40 percent lower risk of dying at an early age than those who are active for less than 30 minutes per week.

The following items are benefits of physical activity:
<h3>Diabetes Prevention:</h3>
The <a href=\"http://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/research-areas/diabetes/diabetes-prevention-program-dpp/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)</a> conducted a major study of 3,234 people at high risk for diabetes. The study’s findings showed that people can delay and possibly prevent type 2 diabetes by losing 5 to 7 percent of their total body weight, performing at least 30 minutes of moderate–intensity physical activity 5 days a week and eating a variety of healthy foods that are high in fiber and low in fat. Participants in the DPP who made lifestyle changes in diet and exercise reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. This was almost twice the reduction seen in the group that received medication (31 percent).
<h3>Strengthened Cardiovascular System:</h3>
Regular activity strengthens the heart muscle, lowers blood pressure, raises high–density lipoprotein levels (good cholesterol), lowers low–density lipoprotein levels (bad cholesterol), improves blood flow and helps the heart to function more efficiently. All of these benefits reduce the risk of peripheral vascular disease, stroke, heart disease and high blood pressure.
<h3>Resisting Osteoporosis:</h3>
As with muscles, bones become stronger — and stay stronger — with regular exercise, preventing or even reversing any increased rates of bone loss.
<h3>Reduced Risk of Obesity:</h3>
A <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000332\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> published in PLoS Medicine found that physical activity decreases an active individual’s obesity risk by 40 percent. Another significant finding in the study showed that an individual with a greater genetic predisposition to obesity, when compared to an individual with a lesser predisposition to obesity, can markedly decrease his or her likelihood of becoming obese by becoming physically active.

In addition to items listed above, physical activity also produces the following benefits:
<ul>
 	<li>Decreases the risk of certain forms of cancer (e.g., colon and breast cancers)</li>
 	<li>Lowers blood pressure</li>
 	<li>Improves cholesterol levels, C–reactive protein and other CHD indicators</li>
 	<li>Plays an important role in weight management</li>
 	<li>Preserves bone mass and reduces the risk of falling, thereby helping to maintain the functional independence of older adults</li>
 	<li>May prevent and improve mild to moderate depressive disorders and anxiety</li>
 	<li>Enhances feelings of energy, well–being, quality of life and cognitive function</li>
 	<li>Is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia</li>
 	<li>Improves quality of sleep</li>
 	<li>Is associated with fewer problems with erectile dysfunction in men</li>
 	<li>Improves life expectancy</li>
</ul>
The frequency, length, type and intensity of exercise an individual performs should be determined by an individual’s goals, fitness level, age, health, skills, interest and convenience. However, most experts agree that most adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate–intensity exercise each week.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
To avoid the dangers of physical inactivity and to reap the many benefits exercise has to offer, it is important that physical activity becomes a regular and permanent habit that is incorporated into your daily life. It is one of the easiest and one of the most effective ways in which you can improve your overall health.

1400,1,"2014-12-08 19:14:11","2014-12-08 19:14:11","A study by the <a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2007/12000/Occupation_Specific_Absenteeism_Costs_Associated.7.aspx\">Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine</a> (JOEM) examined the economic impact of obesity in the United States by analyzing the number of days missed in a year by American workers across different weight classifications. The results showed that \"costs of absenteeism rise with clinical weight classification for both women and men, and vary across occupation. Absenteeism costs associated with obesity total $4.3 billion annually in the United States.\"

The authors' conclusion has a rather understated, if not surprising, solution for curbing the substantial costs to American business associated with obesity: \"Employers should explore workplace interventions and health care expansions to reduce these costs.\" Indeed, they should.

Corporate leaders have come to the realization that, in order to be healthy, employees need to embrace healthy lifestyle habits. Yet, many of us do not have the knowledge, time, or motivation to make the right choices. Thus, forward-thinking companies are adding <a href=\"../../../../com/eheintl/www/programs.html\">preventive health programs</a> to their suite of employee benefits. As part of such a program, employees are able to make key lifestyle and behavior modifications by working with physicians, health coaches, nutritionists, and other health professionals. This is especially important for anyone struggling with obesity or other chronic conditions that affect their work productivity.

\"We dedicate resources to prevention because, like any successful investment we’ve made, it yields steady returns,\" writes William C. Weldon, Chairman and CEO, Johnson &amp; Johnson, in the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/01/web-exclusive-fix-the-health-care-crisis-one-employee-at-a-time\">Harvard Business Review</a>. \"Those returns take two forms: a healthier, more productive, more committed workforce and significantly lower overall healthcare costs. For every dollar we invest in our workers’ health, we see a return of more than $4 in reduced health care costs, lower absenteeism, and improved productivity.\"
<h3>Employee Health Intervention = Employer Success</h3>
In addition to implementing a preventive health program, many companies are also beginning to \"walk the walk\" in regard to important obesity risk factors such as diet and exercise.
Diet. Consuming adequate amounts of fruits and vegetables as part of an overall healthy diet has <a href=\"http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/vegetables-why.html\">proven</a> to decrease the risk of developing obesity and other debilitating conditions. Individuals who already have a dangerously high body mass index can take immediate steps in their diet and dramatically improve their health. A company’s policies and corporate culture can foster healthy eating by providing healthy snacks and drinks in the break room, installing adequate kitchen supplies for employees to refrigerate and reheat home cooked lunches, and allowing sufficient time for lunch breaks so that staff are not forced to grab unhealthy fast food on the run.
<img src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/absenteeism_treadmill.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"absenteeism_treadmill\" align=\"right\" />Exercise. Many Americans are physically inactive, which is a major contributor to the obesity epidemic. Exercise is a vital part of health living; the more you move, the better your health outcomes. According to the <a href=\"http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/chapter2.aspx\">CDC</a>, people who are physically active for approximately 7 hours per week have a 40% lower risk of dying at an early age than those who are active for less than 30 minutes per week. The American <a href=\"http://www.acsm.org/access-public-information/brochures-fact-sheets/fact-sheets\">College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)</a> concurs, reporting that most causes of death are delayed by regular performance of physical activity.

\"As a triathlete, I am a big proponent of exercise as a preventive health measure and strongly believe that every leader is accountable for promoting the health and wellness of their employees,\" says Ana Dutra CEO of the Executives’ Club of Chicago at a event sponsored by the <a href=\"http://www.ncppa.org/news/250th-ceo-signs-ceo-pledge-physical-activity\">National Coalition for Promoting Physical Activity</a>. \"With healthcare costs spiraling out of control, wellness and prevention have become strategic business imperatives - in addition to creating a healthier, happier and more productive workforce, these initiatives directly impact the bottom line.\"
<h3>Taking Our (Preventive) Medicine</h3>
The JOEM study is not new information. Other studies in recent years have <a href=\"http://www.acoem.org/uploadedFiles/Healthy_Workplaces_Now/Value%20of%20Health-Power%20of%20Prevention.pdf\">documented the costs</a> of employee absenteeism and reduced on-the-job productivity due to poor health. Preventing disease increases productivity, period. The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/policy/resources/Investingin_ReducesEmployerCosts.pdf\">CDC estimates</a> that asthma, high blood pressure, smoking, and obesity each reduce annual productivity by between $200 and $440 per person.

EHE physician Dr. Frederica Linick says it is understandable that \"multiple medical problems associated with obesity would affect all aspects of life, including work absenteeism (back pain, knee pain, heart disease, medical complications of high blood pressure and diabetes, fatigue, etc). The employer can encourage employees to make changes, but it's ultimately up to the individual.\"

1401,1,"2015-09-15 19:14:13","2015-09-15 19:14:13","September is considered “National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month,” where numerous organizations and experts seek to raise awareness for prostate health, inform about the risk factors for prostate cancer, and encourage prostate screenings.

This month is right before “National Breast Cancer Awareness Month” (October) where there is a similar push for awareness and prevention, but this time for the breasts.

Both men and women can get both types of cancers, but prostate cancer is much more prevalent in men and breast cancer is much more prevalent in women, inevitably causing gendered associations.

While October enjoys a flood of pink ribbons (the symbol used in support of breast cancer), you’d be hard-pressed to find a blue ribbon (the symbol used in support of prostate cancer) in September—which underpins a major issue: Men’s health, in general, needs a major push so that men of all ages can be made aware of their increased risk for disease and death.
<h3>A Proclivity for Lifestyle Diseases</h3>
According to <a href=\"http://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/everyday-healthy-living/sexual-health/men-take-charge-of-your-health#the-basics_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Healthfinder.org</a>, compared to women, men are more likely to:
<ul>
 	<li>“Smoke</li>
 	<li>Drink alcohol</li>
 	<li>Make unhealthy or risky choices</li>
 	<li>Put off regular checkups and medical care”</li>
</ul>
These behaviors are all common risk factors for lifestyle diseases—those that are associated and brought upon by how an individual lives. These diseases, according to <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=38316\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medicinenet.com</a>, include “atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke; obesity and type 2 diabetes; and diseases associated with smoking and alcohol and drug abuse.”

Additionally, lifestyle disease is becoming more of a problem in the U.S. According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/p0501-preventable-deaths.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>:

<em>“The five leading causes of death in the United States are heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, and unintentional injuries. Together they accounted for 63 percent of all U.S. deaths in 2010, with rates for each cause varying greatly from state to state.” </em>

Unsurprisingly, the <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/life-expectancy-by-gender/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kaiser Family Foundation</a> finds that life expectancy of a man is several years fewer than that of a woman, which speaks nothing of the quality of life that a man who smokes, drinks, and makes unhealthy choices leads.
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
From this we can gather that men are a prime audience for preventive healthcare and education. Unfortunately, the reason for this is because they are more susceptible to unhealthy behavior. As this month is Prostate Cancer Awareness Month—essentially a month designated for men’s health considering the gendered association—and seeing the extreme push that occurs for Breast Cancer Awareness (which is typically aimed at female health), now is the time for men to consider their current and future states of health.

1402,1,"2015-10-06 19:14:14","2015-10-06 19:14:14","Wearing contact lenses is typically a convenient and safe form of vision correction, but sometimes convenience breeds complacency.

Keeping your contacts clean and maintained is of the utmost importance because these medical devices are placed directly on the eye, and unhygienic use will eventually cause certain eye infections and vision problems.

And while this may appear obvious, it isn’t unheard of for contact lens wearers to forget to wear, wash or store their lenses properly, or even discard them after prolonged use.

Actually that last point—about it not being unheard of for contact lens wearers to exhibit unhygienic behavior—is an understatement. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:

<em> “An estimated one in six adults in the United States wears contact lenses, and one third of them report at least one health care visit for a red or painful eye while wearing lenses. Approximately 99% of contact lens wearers reported at least one risk behavior ever for eye infections or inflammation. Of particular concern, contact lens wearers of all types frequently reported exposure of their contact lenses to water, including storing or rinsing their lenses in tap water and showering or swimming while wearing lenses.”</em>

This is very revealing. It means that contact lens wearers are among the most at-risk for eye infections. And it's not only because they neglect to care for their contacts. A recent <a href=\"http://nyulangone.org/press-releases/contact-lens-wearers-take-note-your-eyes-may-get-more-infections-because-their-microbiomes-have-changed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> by NYU Langone reports that the bacteria present in the eyes of contact wearers is different from that of non-wearers:

<em>“Specifically, the NYU Langone team found that the eye surface, or conjunctiva, has surprisingly higher bacterial diversity than the skin directly beneath the eye and three times the usual proportion of Methylobacterium, Lactobacillus, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas bacteria in the eyes of the study’s nine contact lens wearers than is typically found on the surface of the eyeballs of 11 other men and women in the study who did not wear contact lenses. When measured and plotted on a graph, statistical germ diversity scores showed that the eye microbiome of contact lens wearers had a composition more similar to that of the wearer’s skin than the eye microbiome of non-lens wearers.” </em>
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health</h3>
It is almost ironic that the devices used to improve one’s vision so that he/she may have a greater quality of life may, in the end, cause that person to have diminished or lost vision. In the end, contact lens wearers should be more prudent with their vision.

1403,1,"2015-03-13 19:14:16","2015-03-13 19:14:16","Over the past decade, the word “core” has become a very popular buzzword within the fitness community. There are many fitness product commercials and websites that equate the strengthening of one’s core to improved athletic performance. However, like many health-related topics, the true importance of the core is hidden underneath a commonly held misconception: that strengthening the core leads to improved performance. In actuality, the main benefit of a strong core is injury prevention.
<h3>What are the Core Muscles?</h3>
The muscles and tendons that make up an individual’s core include the rectus abdominis, transversus abdominis, internal and external obliques, erector spinae, multifidus, the pelvic floor, and the diaphragm; essentially, the <em>core</em> includes everything except for the limbs and appendages. The muscles of the core work to support, stiffen, and stabilize the spine, abdomen, and pelvis; distributing and generating force without placing undo stress on the joints.
<h3>Core Stability, Athletic Performance, and Injury Prevention</h3>
A core-strengthening program increases <em>core stability</em>, which is the capacity of the body to return to equilibrium (or balance) after being in a state of non-equilibrium. Activities that attempt to throw off the body’s equilibrium can generally be called “functional movements.” Participating in sports, riding the subway, and even getting up from a chair are functional movements as the body is constantly re-aligning its center of gravity to effectively handle force distribution.

<img class=\"alignright wp-image-1519\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Class.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth307ampnameClass.jpg\" alt=\"Class of diverse people doing pilates\" width=\"402\" height=\"268\" />Functional training, or training for specific movements, has become popular among athletes and fitness enthusiasts alike. The thinking is that if you train your body to effectively transfer force with movements that mimic those that would occur in a real-life scenario (like throwing a medicine ball to mimic passing a basketball), your body will adapt to these movements and be able to execute them better. This is the basis for the argument that core strength equals improved performance, and it is easy to make this argument when individuals are incorporating a total body workout in addition to core strengthening.

<a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2011/01000/Relationship_Between_Core_Stability,_Functional.36.aspx\">Study</a> after <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19026017\">study</a> has concluded, however, that functional training and core strengthening alone do not increase performance. You might be wondering then, “if this stuff doesn’t make me jump higher or run faster then what’s the point?” <em>The point is preventive healthcare.</em> While most studies attempting to link core strength and athletic performance have been met with underwhelming results, there is a wealth of literature espousing the link between core strength and injury prevention.

The article “<a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/acsm-csmr/Abstract/2008/01000/Core_Stability_Exercise_Principles.14.aspx\">Core Stability Exercise Principles (2008)</a>,” remarks that individuals with lower back pain (LBP) have “delayed contraction of the transversus abdominis and multifidi prior to limb movement.” Additionally, the document notes that “people with sacroiliac pain have impaired recruitment of the diaphragm and pelvic floor.” This shows that individuals with weak cores are susceptible to these and other musculoskeletal injuries.

Another <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1745-6673-2-3.pdf\">study</a> showed that in the dangerous world of firefighting, an occupation that requires extensive functional movements in less than ideal situations, injuries were reduced significantly when the firefighters were placed under a core strengthening program:

<em>“Comparing the number of injuries pre- and post- intervention of these 433 firefighters, loss time injuries were reduced by 62%, whereas total injuries were reduced by 44% compared to a historical group.”</em>

This is significant because, according to article, “injuries are the leading cause of mortality and loss of potential years of life for working individuals.”
<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
By only strengthening your core, you won’t become a better athlete because the core efficiently distributes force rather than generating it. What you will accomplish, however, is even more important. You will improve your body’s ability to maintain equilibrium, protect against injury and various health conditions related to the muscles and joints, and increase your functional independence.  So, while it may not improve your performance on the basketball court, functional training can increase the strength of the muscles that provide stability and mobility for the spine, pelvis, rib cage, and hips.

However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), these common chronic diseases are some of the most costly and preventable of all health issues in the United States today. Creating a culture of health that encourages and rewards healthy behaviors at work can help to lower or eliminate risk factors for these diseases.

Organizations that institute policies and programs that encourage healthy behaviors can lower their indirect costs (e.g., absenteeism and poor productivity) and direct costs (e.g., health premiums, disability, and workers compensation claims). According to the CDC, indirect costs of poor health may be more damaging to a business than the direct costs. The CDC estimates that “productivity losses related to personal and family health issues cost employers $1,685 per employee per year, or $225.8 billion annually.”

It is important for organizations to keep in mind that employees come in all shapes, sizes, and fitness levels. Although each situation is unique and will call for specially tailored programs, some examples of workplace health initiatives that can foster a culture of health include:
<ul>
 	<li>Offering health education classes, including classes on nutrition, fitness and stress reduction</li>
 	<li>Offering tobacco cessation programs</li>
 	<li>Instituting policies that promote healthy behaviors such as a tobacco-free workplace policy</li>
 	<li>Negotiating a discount to a local fitness facility</li>
 	<li>Offering employee incentives for receiving appropriate preventive screenings</li>
 	<li>Offering employee outcome-based incentives for blood pressure, weight management and BMI</li>
 	<li>Making healthy food choices available and accessible through vending machines and/ or cafeterias</li>
 	<li>Posting nutritional information in workplace cafeterias</li>
 	<li>Offering opportunities for physical activity, such as an accessible walking trail or onsite fitness center</li>
 	<li>Encouraging employees who sit behind a desk for most of the day to take stretch breaks to improve their circulation and work efficiency</li>
</ul>
Of course, it is important to realize that one size does not fit all, and organizations will need to determine which strategies to incorporate based on their employees needs and interests, and what is affordable and feasible for the organization. Additionally organizations must recognize that creating a culture of health cannot and will not happen overnight. A well-designed program will address the physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual health of employees. It will be a challenging, long-term process that will require persistent and persuasive leadership at all levels of an organization and constant communication. However, based on numerous studies, employers can expect that instituting high-quality, comprehensive, employee-focused workplace health programs may lead to positive changes for both the employer and the employee.

For example, there are numerous conflicting claims regarding the cause of obesity.

Some reports indicate that obesity is largely a product of diet and environment (and is therefore modifiable), while others indicate that obesity is largely a product of genetics and cannot be changed.

According to an article titled, <a href=\"http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-causes/genes-and-obesity/\">“Genes Are Not Destiny,”</a> that appears on the Harvard School of Public Health’s Obesity Prevention Source website, current research into the causes of obesity indicate that an individual’s genes do not determine if he or she is destined to become obese. Evidence from this study also shows that individuals who have a healthy lifestyle and are immersed in a healthy environment can significantly decrease their chances of becoming obese.

Conversely, a study by UCLA researchers that was published in <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413112001891\"><i>Cell Metabolism</i></a> found that the amount of food consumed by subjects (mice) in the study had a minor effect on their likelihood of becoming obese. Researchers claim that the amount of weight gained by an individual is influenced by his or her genetic makeup much more than diet, even among individuals who consume a high-calorie diet with large amounts of added sugar.
<h3>The Bottom Line—For Your Health</h3>
In the above examples, both studies are published by seemingly credible sources and likely contain sound, evidence-based information. So, neither article may necessarily be ‘wrong.’ However, one may contain information that is more applicable to an individual’s life than the other. A cursory look at the articles reveals an important difference: the study(s) referenced in the “Genes Are Not Destiny” article involved humans, while the study referenced in the Cell Metabolism article involved mice. By identifying this key difference between the articles, an individual is able to put the information in a clearer perspective.

If you don’t take certain health precautions, you may eventually pay the consequences. Stomach and digestive problems should not be the price of your visit nor a test of your mettle as a traveler. A night or two spent in a hotel bathroom is no fun, and stomach infections can lead to aggravated health issues, especially for children or individuals with compromised immune systems.

“While you can be adventurous in your travels, try not to be so adventurous in your food choices while in third world countries,” says EHE International travel medicine nurse practitioner Marianne Dyke. “Nobody wants digestive distress while away from home.”

Diarrhea affects 30% to 70% of travelers and is the most <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002433.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predictable travel-related illness</a>. Your personal health status and travel destination greatly impacts the types of precautions you should take. The exposure potential is relative to the season and destination:
<ul>
 	<li>Low risk: United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Western Europe</li>
 	<li>Intermediate risk: Eastern Europe, South Africa, Caribbean islands</li>
 	<li>High risk: Asia, Middle East, Africa, Mexico, Central and South America</li>
</ul>
<h3>Traveler’s Health Scourge</h3>
Diarrhea is more than inconvenient. Bacteria and viruses may cause severe dehydration and lead to gastrointestinal problems. In extreme cases, infections become acute medical conditions requiring a hospital stay. A doctor may recommend a <a href=\"http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-2-the-pre-travel-consultation/travelers-diarrhea\">prophylactic vaccine</a> (such as against Typhoid) if exposure is unavoidable.

Traveler’s diarrhea is common, but many of us don’t know what preventive health measures to take and rely on word-of-mouth or unscientific remedies. Follow a few simple steps in your daily routine:
<ul>
 	<li>Drink only bottled water and beverages</li>
 	<li>Do not eat from street vendors in third world countries</li>
 	<li>Eat well cooked foods or steamed vegetables in restaurants regardless of your location</li>
 	<li>Avoid raw fruit and vegetables</li>
 	<li>Do not use ice in beverages</li>
 	<li>Brush your teeth with bottled water</li>
</ul>
The best advice for avoiding diarrhea is to <a href=\"../../../../com/eheintl/www/travelmed.html\">talk with a travel medicine doctor</a>. A doctor trained in preventive health for travelers will help plan your itinerary and provide care specific to your needs. With proper information and smart choices, you will not have to worry about diarrhea—and enjoy your travels.

Seemingly slight differences in structure translate into crucial differences in form and function.”
<!--more--></span>
<h3>Types of Dietary Fat</h3>
There are three main types of dietary fat: unsaturated, saturated, and trans.

<strong>Unsaturated Fats: </strong> Often referred to as the “good” fats, unsaturated fats are either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. According to the <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good\">Harvard Medical School</a>, unsaturated fats are usually liquid at room temperature and are found mainly in plant–based sources. Polyunsaturated fats are referred to as essential fats because the body requires them for good health but cannot synthesize them on its own, so they must be obtained from food.

Unsaturated fats can be found in olive, peanut, sunflower, corn, soybean, and flaxseed oils; avocados; nuts; seeds; and fish. Unsaturated fats are considered to be beneficial because they may help improve and maintain blood cholesterol levels, reduce blood pressure, ease inflammation, and stabilize heart rhythms.

<strong>Saturated Fats: </strong> According to the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyEating/Saturated-Fats_UCM_301110_Article.jsp\">American Heart Association (AHA)</a>, “From a chemical standpoint, saturated fats are simply fat molecules that have no double bonds between carbon molecules because they are saturated with hydrogen molecules.”

These fats can be found in red meat, butter, whole milk, dairy products made with whole or 2 percent milk, cheeses, palm and coconut oils, and many commercially prepared baked goods and fried foods.

Interestingly, recent research has called the association between saturated fats and cardiovascular disease into question. A <a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1846638\">systematic review and meta-analysis</a> examining the association between dietary fatty acids and coronary heart disease (CHD) published in the March 18, 2014 <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>, concluded that, “Current evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total saturated fats.” A <a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/91/3/535.full\">meta-analysis</a> of 21 studies that appeared in the March 2010 issue of <i>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i> found that there was not enough evidence to conclude that saturated fat increases the risk of CHD or cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Despite this conflicting evidence, the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Cholesterol/PreventionTreatmentofHighCholesterol/Know-Your-Fats_UCM_305628_Article.jsp#.VnmIsPkrJMw\">AHA</a> recommends limiting saturated fats to less than 7 percent of one’s total daily calories because “Decades of sound science has proven it can raise your “bad” cholesterol and put you at higher risk for heart disease.”

<strong>Trans Fats: </strong> There are two types of trans fats in the diet: those formed naturally and those created during food processing.

Those formed naturally are produced in the gut of some grazing animals. According to the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Cholesterol/PreventionTreatmentofHighCholesterol/Know-Your-Fats_UCM_305628_Article.jsp\">AHA</a>, trans fats that are created during processing (also called “partially hydrogenated oils”) “are created in an industrial process that adds hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid.”

The primary source of trans fats in the American diet are foods containing industrially–modified and partially–hydrogenated vegetable oils such as fried foods, pizza dough, pie crust, margarine, chips, and commercially baked goods such as pastries, cookies, doughnuts, and crackers.

Artificial trans fats are harmful because they raise bad (LDL) cholesterol levels and lower good (HDL) cholesterol levels, which are risk factors for heart disease. The AHA recommends limiting artificial trans fats to less than one percent of total daily calories.
<h3>Benefits of Fats</h3>
Although the excessive consumption of some fats can cause serious health issues, individuals should not cut out fats altogether because fats are essential to health. In addition to providing the body with energy, fats serve many other important functions; according to <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good\">Harvard Medical School</a>, fats aid in:
<ul>
 	<li>The absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K as well as carotenoids</li>
 	<li>Blood clotting</li>
 	<li>Muscle movement</li>
 	<li>Inflammation</li>
 	<li>Building cell membranes</li>
 	<li>Building the sheaths that surround nerves</li>
</ul>
It is important to keep in mind that all fats are very high in calories and therefore must be eaten in moderation as part of an overall well–balanced diet. Unfortunately, according to the <a href=\"https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/\"><i>Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2015</i></a>, the diets of most Americans contain far more fat than the body needs. The consistent consumption of excessive fat, particularly excessive amounts of the wrong types of fat, can lead to serious health complications. It is important for you to be aware of the fat content of the foods you consume and try to replace most saturated and trans fats with healthier unsaturated fats because these types of fats will help promote your health and well-being.","What is Dietary Fat?","Learn about dietary fat.","publish","open","open","","dietary-fat","","","2017-07-20 16:17:54","2017-07-20 16:17:54","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/dietary-fat/",0,"post","",0

This series, titled “Digestive Health,” will help you discover how food and drink is broken down; why the kinds of food that you ingest affect your digestion and consequently your health; and what you can do to keep your digestive system in optimal working condition.</em>
<h3><strong>
Digestive Health: An Introduction to Digestion</strong></h3>
Digestion is like breathing: it’s an important, automatic bodily process that isn’t given a second thought unless something goes wrong; but unlike breathing, digestion is complex and requires consistent maintenance.

This article will inform readers what the digestive system is and how it works so they can begin to have a deeper understanding of its significance.
<h3><strong>What is the Digestive System?</strong></h3>
According to the <a href=\"http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Anatomy/your-digestive-system/Documents/Digestive_System_508.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDKD)</a>, “The digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract—also called the digestive tract—and the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder.” It is made up of hollow organs and solid organs. The hollow organs are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines. The solid organs include the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. Together the components of the digestive system utilize muscle movements, digestive juices, enzymes, and bacteria to break down, extract, and distribute the nutrition present in foods and drink.
<h3><strong>Digestion in Action</strong></h3>
<img class=\"alignright wp-image-1532\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ThinkstockPhotos-475549977.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth200ampnameThinkstockPhotos-475549977.jpg\" alt=\"Digestion in Action\" width=\"361\" height=\"481\" />Digestion first begins in the mouth, a hollow organ that leads to the esophagus. The mouth uses mastication (chewing) in order to break down foods into smaller bits. While chewing is taking place, saliva is secreted by the salivary glands in the mouth to break down complex carbohydrates as well as to moisten the food bits so that they may be swallowed.

Swallowing is performed by the esophagus, a hollow organ which leads to the stomach. Food that is swallowed is involuntarily pushed by the muscles in the esophagus towards the lower esophageal sphincter (the muscle that controls what goes into the stomach) in a process called esophageal peristalsis.

Food passes through the esophageal sphincter and enters the stomach, a hollow organ that leads to the duodenum of the small intestine. Here, food is mixed with hydrochloric acid (to further break down food bits) and proteases (an enzyme secreted by the pancreas that turns proteins into amino acids). The stomach is lined with muscles that churn this mixture (via peristalsis) into chime--a mass of partly digested food.

Chyme enters the duodenum of the small intestine to be further broken down. Digestive juices from the small intestine and pancreas combined with bile from the liver allow the food to be absorbed into the blood where it can be distributed throughout the body. Chyme that wasn’t fully digested for whatever reason is sent to the large intestine.

The large intestine receives waste products and anything else that wasn’t fully digested in the small intestine. It absorbs any remaining water and nutrients before turning the waste into stool, where it is stored in the rectum (as part of the large intestine) to be discharged via defecation.
<div>
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
The digestive process utilizes many components of the body in order to turn food and drink into nourishment. Though as with any process with moving parts, it is subject to malfunction if routine maintenance isn’t upheld. In the next entry in the “Digestive Health” series, we will take a closer look at the components of digestion in order to keep your digestive system running at peak performance.

1409,1,"2015-08-13 19:14:27","2015-08-13 19:14:27","When it comes to peace of mind, your gut is largely influential. In fact, a 2008 paper titled, “<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2805706/pdf/nihms162299.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brain foods: the effects of nutrients on brain function</a>,” goes into detail on how the nutrients of food impact the enzymes of the gut, which consequently interact with neurons in the brain. But even though food has a real affect on mood (and brain function for that matter), many Americans suffer from digestive disorders. The <a href=\"http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/digestive-diseases-statistics-for-the-united-states.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)</a> remarks that “60 to 70 million people are affected by all digestive diseases’—almost a quarter of the population.

Digestive disorders impact the processing of nutrients and bring on discomfort. Some of the most common are chronic constipation, acid reflux, gallstones and irritable bowel syndrome. This article will examine these disorders and setup one’s diet as the main determinant to good (or bad) digestive health.
<h3><strong>Chronic Constipation</strong></h3>
One of the worst feelings is being backed up, and unfortunately many Americans face this scenario on a daily basis. According to the <a href=\"http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/artic/constipation_niddk.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NIDDK</a> constipation “is the most common gastrointestinal complaint in the United States” accounting for 2 million annual doctor visits and $725 million spent annually on laxatives.

Constipation is described as infrequent (less than three times a week) bowel movements which are hard and dry in appearance and texture. For comparison, many individuals move their bowels one to three times a day.

Constipation occurs when the large intestines, responsible for absorbing fluid and nutrients of food before it moves to the rectum, absorbs too much fluid leaving a hardened stool. These stools are difficult to pass and result in infrequent bowel movements.

While typically seen as more of an annoyance than anything, constipation (when chronic) can lead to problems that can become severe. Hemorrhoids (swollen or inflamed veins in the anal canal), anal fissures (a skin break or tear in the anal canal), and fecal impaction (hard stool packed in the intestine and rectum over time) are complications that can result from constipation.

The causes of constipation are varied, but the most common are: not enough fiber in the diet, not enough liquids in the diet, pregnancy, lack of exercise, stress, and ironically the overuse of laxatives.
<h3><strong>Acid Reflux</strong></h3>
For those who’ve ever had heartburn, the thought of getting it again is enough to throw off one’s appetite. Heartburn is caused by acid reflux, a situation where the lower esophageal sphincter (the circular group of muscles that control what goes into the stomach from the esophagus) either doesn’t close all the way after allowing food to pass or opens to frequently. This allows stomach acid to enter the esophagus and creates a burning sensation.

Individuals who have frequent heartburn, typically twice or more a week should see a doctor as they may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). According to <a href=\"../../../../com/eheintl/www/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NIDDK</a>, some common symptoms of GERD is: “bad breath, nausea, pain in your chest or the upper part of your abdomen, problems swallowing or painful swallowing, respiratory problems, vomiting, the wearing away of your teeth”.

If left untreated, GERD can cause complications such as esophagitis (damaged tissue lining the esophagus leading to bleeding and ulcers), difficulty swallowing, respiratory problems, and Barret’s esophagus (a condition where esophagus tissue is replaced by tissue resembling that found in the intestine). Unchecked cases of esophagitis and Barret’s esophagus can lead to cancer.

Treating reflux involves lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery if necessary. Lifestyle changes involve abstaining from smoking, drinking alcohol, and eating greasy, spicy foods. Medications typically involve ingesting an antacid. Surgery is usually an extreme case and typically involves the individual suffering from some physical abnormality that allows GERD to persist.
<h3><strong>Gallstones</strong></h3>
<img class=\"alignright wp-image-1535\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ThinkstockPhotos-493705897.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth300ampnameThinkstockPhotos-493705897.jpg\" alt=\"Woman on Couch\" width=\"367\" height=\"255\" />Like kidney stones, gallstones are hardened material that can become trapped in troublesome places. The gall bladder contains the secreted bile from the liver before it is used in the small intestines. The bile gets to the small intestine via the biliary tract. If a gallstone (or stones) gets trapped in the biliary tract it can sudden and shooting pain in the abdomen, known as a gallbladder attack.

Gallstones can be really small or quite large (about the size of a golf ball). Also, there can be many gallstones present in the gallbladder at one time, each of which can vary in size. According to <a href=\"http://womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/the-healthy-woman/digestive_health.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">womenshealth.gov</a> these stones are formed when there is an excess of cholesterol in the liquid bile or if the gallbladder doesn’t empty entirely or not enough.

Risk factors for gallstones include: having a family history of gallstones, being overweight or obese, consuming a energy-rich, nutrient-poor diet, losing a lot of weight very quickly, being older than 60, have diabetes, or are American Indian or Mexican American.

If a gallstone gets trapped in one of the bile ducts it can eventually cause severe damage to the biliary tract, the gallbladder, and the liver. Gallstones can even become fatal in this manner. Fortunately, individuals can reduce their risk for gallstones by eating a low-cholesterol diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and staying active.
<h3><strong>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</strong></h3>
IBS is a common yet mysterious disease: it affects approximately 10 to 15 percent of the US population yet doesn’t have a known cause, and diagnosis is based on a pattern of common digestion issues such as abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation—meaning it can easily be mistaken for something else.

According to the <a href=\"http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/irritable-bowel-syndrome/Pages/definition-facts.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NIDDK</a>, this disease is classified into four types: 1) IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), Mixed IBS (IBS-M), and Unsubtyped IBS (IBS-U). These distinctions are determined by stool sample and will affect the type of treatment advice from doctors.

Symptoms of IBS are typically abdominal pain and a change in bowel movement frequency. While these symptoms are minor, their triggers are many, such as: motility problems in the colon, consuming certain foods, and feelings of stress stemming from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder can all trigger IBS symptoms.

Treatment of IBS typically involves changes to one’s diet and going after the physical symptoms the person experiences—such as taking fiber supplements for constipation, antidepressants for stress, and antispasmodics to control motility.
<div>
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
Digestive disorders are common and share similarities in both symptoms and treatment. If you are having trouble going or are experiencing inexplicable abdominal pain then you should schedule a visit with your doctor if these conditions persist. Usually they will recommend a change in diet.

Of course, prevention is always better than treatment, so in the next entry in the “Digestive Health” series we will look at how diet affects the digestion system, for better or for worse.

1410,1,"2015-08-20 19:14:29","2015-08-20 19:14:29","According to the Health Services department at Cornell University (Gannet), “The most immediate benefit of dietary fiber is its improvement of digestive function.” This article will examine fiber’s role in digestion with particular emphasis on how it affects the colon.
<h3>What is Dietary Fiber?</h3>
According to <a href=\"https://www.gannett.cornell.edu/cms/pdf/chep/upload/fiber-digestion-and-health.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gannet</a>, “Dietary fiber is the edible component of plant foods that can’t be digested by humans.” While it doesn’t provide any nutritional value, dietary fiber aids digestion by improving the absorption of nutrients, the presence of intestinal bacteria, and the colon’s motility (moving indigestible material to the rectum).

There are two types of dietary fiber: soluble (able to be dissolved in water) and insoluble fiber.

According to <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002136.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medline Plus</a>, soluble fiber dissolves into a gel substance when it reaches the colon. This process occurs through colonic fermentation—whereby bacteria in the colon interact with ingested material in order to produce gases and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which have numerous health benefits including controlling blood glucose (sugar) levels and improving intestinal immune function.

Insoluble fiber doesn’t dissolve in water, but rather attracts and absorbs it. This serves to add bulk to your diet as it makes you feel full, improve the consistency of stool through hydration, and increases bowel movements by engaging colonic motility.

Soluble fiber is found in “oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables,” whereas insoluble is found in “wheat bran, vegetables, and whole grains.”
<h3>Utilizing Dietary Fiber for Improved Health</h3>
<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1538\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ThinkstockPhotos-479726218.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth185ampnameThinkstockPhotos-479726218.jpg\" alt=\"Food\" width=\"339\" height=\"508\" />Adding fiber to your diet is one of the best ways to improve your digestive health, especially if you suffer from constipation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Constipation is a result of infrequent bowel movements (typically less than 3 times a week) which tend to produce hard and dry stool. Insoluble fiber addresses these issues as it absorbs water in the colon during digestion and both softens and moistens stool. In addition, the consistency of this stool is able to be easily moved to the rectum by the colon, increasing bowel movement.

IBS typically includes abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements. While treatment outside of diet (e.g., being prescribed probiotics and going to stress management) aid in treating this complex disease, adding fiber is still one of the quickest and most effective solutions to controlling symptoms. As mentioned previously, fiber increases regularity constipation and improves consistency which relieves constipation and diarrhea respectively. As there is no single treatment for IBS—and particularly the pain associated with it—prevention is the best form of medicine. Sticking to a healthy diet with plenty of fiber, along with performing exercise and other healthy behaviors, is the best way to combat this disease.
<h3>Dietary Fiber Recommendations</h3>
While fiber is important for digestive health, too much of it can cause symptoms that typically result from poor digestive health; e.g., gas, bloating, and abdominal pain. According to <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002470.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medline Plus</a>, “The average American now eats 10 to 15 grams of fiber per day. The recommendation for older children, adolescents, and adults is to eat 20 to 35 grams of fiber each day.”
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
As the average American doesn’t get enough fiber in their diet it is likely beneficial that the inclusion of additional fiber will aid in digestive health. Both types of fiber (soluble and insoluble) are necessary for the proper maintenance of the colon and to prevent issues that stem from poor colonic health (e.g., constipation, diarrhea, etc). Whole grains, nuts and seeds, and fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of fiber and should always be added to your diet.

1411,1,"2014-10-24 19:14:31","2014-10-24 19:14:31","As the saying goes, “knowledge is power.” When it comes to personal health, however, many prefer another adage: “ignorance is bliss.” Visiting the doctor for a medical exam and learning one’s overall health status may stir up thoughts of mortality and guilt for not taking better care of our bodies, especially as we age. This avoidance mindset will not help us make pro-active decisions about our health.

“Avoiding medical tests because of anxiety can cause more health problems, such as fatigue, muscle tension, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping, according to the <a href=\"http://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad/symptoms\">Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a>,” writes John Fortunbury in <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/when-health-ignorance-is-bliss/381370/2/\">The Atlantic</a>. “Even if the worry is only an occasional one, [anxiety] weakens the immune system.”
<h2>A Matter of Perspective</h2>
You can turn around fear of seeking and understanding health information by embracing medical screenings and preventive exams as tools to build a plan to get and/or stay healthy. When a doctor conducts a thorough exam and provides the results, you are in command. If you take control over medical information, instead of the other way around, you will not only alleviate anxiety but change your health outcomes.

EHE Physician Dr. Gabriella Trotta-Barni says, “knowledge of certain information, such as cholesterol levels or blood pressure can be empowering; with a change in lifestyle habits, like diet and exercise, one can decrease cardiovascular risk, and feel better in general.”
<h2>It's Just a Test</h2>
In other words, approach medical screenings like taking a test. We all take tests in school to measure where we are and what we’ve learned thus far. A medical screening is no different. There’s no failing grade, and it’s not a prescription for your destiny. Preventive medical screenings are conducted to establish a physical health baseline in order to know what to address and where to make improvements.
\"When we avoid preventive tests we take away our greatest weapon in fighting chronic disease,” says psychologist Mike Friedman of EHE’s <a href=\"../../../../com/eheintl/www/executive-mgmt-boards.html\">Medical Advisory Board</a>. “We must remember that most diseases are chronic but controllable if we detect them and implement strong health behaviors.\"

Even if medical screenings find a problem, catching it in the early stages may prevent an ailment from becoming a chronic disease and/or make it more manageable. Don’t leave your medical condition unresolved. Far from being scary, a proper medical screening is your greatest protection from harm and the best resource for improving your overall health.

1413,1,"2014-12-29 19:14:33","2014-12-29 19:14:33","The holidays are a time to enjoy ourselves and to take a mental health break. If we completely lose sight of our health goals, however, holiday rejoicing can quickly turn into regret after the New Year. Now, this doesn’t mean we have to resign ourselves to eating only Kale chips at the holiday parties – we just need to be mindful of eating and exercise.

EHE International fitness experts recommend balancing the extra intake of calories during the season with increased physical activity. Exercising is a simple, effective way to offset the added sweets, fats, and alcohol. Luckily, many of us have more free time during the holidays to run outside, visit the gym, and pound the pavement while shopping and prepping for parties.
“Realistically, this is not the ideal time to make lofty weight loss goals,” says EHE’s Shereé Chambers. “You cannot pack in exercise to lose the weight you promised last year. But you can burn away what you consume now.”
<h3>Holiday Fitness 101</h3>
Our bodies need calories from food for energy, but extra calories are <a href=\"http://www.nutrition.gov/weight-management/commonly-asked-questions-faqs\">stored as fat</a>. The typical holiday dinner plate can triple the body’s daily calorie intake. Since most of us have several high-calorie, low-nutrient meals over the two-week holiday period, we generally far exceed the body’s ability to meet energy needs. This acute uptick in empty calories does more than <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=10727591&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus\">increase waistlines</a>. As fat accumulates, it interferes with the proper functioning of the heart, lungs, liver and digestive tract. <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/22/the-skinny-on-holiday-weight-gain/?_r=0\">Research shows holiday season weight gain</a> adds to net fat accumulation and increases long-term health consequences.

Nature has designed our bodies to gain weight easier than lose it. <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/new-technique-determines-number-fat-cells-remains-constant-all-body-types\">Adipocytes</a> (fat cells) prefer being fat. Increasing the number and size of these cells makes gaining even more weight easier and requires greater effort to “shrink” fat cells. Adipocytes don’t disappear once created, unfortunately. We can only shrink fat cells, but they are eagerly waiting for another opportunity to be overfed and balloon again.
<h3>Holiday Moderation Game Plan</h3>
<strong>Reduce stress and sleep well</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Minimized stress and maximized sleep strengthen willpower and improve overall healthy.</li>
 	<li>Make healthful balanced meals and snacks at home to avoid overindulging at parties.</li>
 	<li>Skipping meals to over-consume later can <a href=\"http://win.niddk.nih.gov/publications/myths.htm\">disrupt metabolism</a> and increased fat storage.</li>
 	<li>Make food-related decisions based on hunger rather than emotional anxiety or exhaustion.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Plan your goals for holiday partying</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Make a list what is truly important to you about holiday parties (e.g., reconnecting with friends, visiting family, etc.). Post the list at home and work for reminders of good times outside of food and drink.</li>
 	<li>Create detailed steps for each holiday meal. For example, fill up on veggies first, choose one small serving of a favorite food instead of grazing everything, and take dessert to-go to avoid the temptation of wanting a second of third helping.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for Negotiating Holiday Events</h3>
<strong>Office Party</strong><img src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/holidayhealth_work.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"holidayhealth_work\" align=\"right\" />
<ul>
 	<li>Start with vegetables and fruit.</li>
 	<li>Keep track of cocktail food and appetizers. Sampling finger foods from every tray can add up to a couple hundred calories.</li>
 	<li>Control temptation. Bring in your own healthful treats to substitute sugary desserts.</li>
 	<li>Limit high-calorie foods such as fried and creamy foods (including sauces, dressings, and cheese), sugary foods, and alcohol.</li>
 	<li>Don’t over-consume just because the food is free</li>
</ul>
<strong>Buffet</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Survey the entire food selection before plating your food.</li>
 	<li>Always start “lean and green” by filling ½ your plate with fruit and vegetables.</li>
 	<li>Don’t waste calories on “average” food. Eat what looks delicious.</li>
 	<li>Take sample sizes to avoid eating a full portion of food simply because it’s on your plate.</li>
 	<li>If you’re still hungry, don’t refill your plate. Choose a small portion of 1 or 2 of the foods you liked best.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Sit-down Dinner</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Start with fruits and vegetables.</li>
 	<li>Keep a visual of the portion plate in mind –
½ fruit and vegetables, ¼ protein and ¼ carbohydrate.</li>
 	<li>Eat slowly. Setting down the fork and knife after each bite. Take time to chew, taste and enjoy your food. Take a drink between bites.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Hosting</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Prepare traditional holiday foods with a healthful twist.</li>
 	<li>Give healthful snacks extra appeal with creative recipes and presentation.</li>
 	<li>Prepare individual servings in ramekin dishes and portion out desserts in bite sizes.</li>
 	<li>Caution: Tasting while cooking can add up in significant calories. Keep healthy snacking vegetables and fruit nearby to nibble (sliced celery, baby carrots, red pepper, grapes, cherries or good options, as well as, citrus-fruit-infused seltzer water).</li>
 	<li>Use food containers, plastic bags and foil to share all tempting leftovers with departing guests.</li>
 	<li>Plan continuous activities. Party games take the emphasis off food, creating an environment focused on celebration and conversation.</li>
</ul>
<strong>As a Guest</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><img src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/holidayhealth_bloated.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"holidayhealth_bloated\" align=\"right\" />Bring a healthy dish to share. In addition, bring at least 2 individual personal snacks as a backup.</li>
 	<li>Avoid temptations to overeat by engaging in conversation and fun activities.</li>
 	<li>To avoid mindless consumption as a relief from boredom or anxiousness, invite a friend along.</li>
 	<li>Plan a timely departure before you become tired.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Dessert</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Implement the one-a-day plan. Allow yourself one small holiday treat each day. You won’t feel deprived. And it will help keep you mindful and on track.</li>
 	<li>Survey the offerings before choosing. Decide what you really want. And pair it with fresh fruit as a backup plan to distract from second helpings.</li>
 	<li>If your sweet tooth generally gets the best of you, postpone dessert.</li>
 	<li>Use the 3-bite-rule on a rich dessert or split it with a friend.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Alcohol</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Decide in advance your drink limit and keep count.</li>
 	<li>Start drinking later after the event begins.</li>
 	<li>Excuse yourself as early as possible.</li>
 	<li>“Nurse” your drinks, bypass rounds, and alternate with non-alcoholic beverages.</li>
 	<li>Choose lower calorie beverages.</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Physical Activity</strong></div>
<ul>
 	<li><img src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Holidayhealth_fit.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"Holidayhealth_fit\" align=\"right\" />Split your exercise routine when time does not allow for a full workout to maintain consistency. Planning 5, 10, or 15 minutes of exercise in the morning helps keep your muscles engaged and your routine intact.</li>
 	<li>Opt for home workouts over the gym to save travel time. Play a DVD, dance to music, or use resistance bands.</li>
 	<li>At lunchtime, squeeze in a quick workout at the gym or go for a walk.</li>
 	<li>On days off, schedule exercise as priority first thing in the morning before the day gets hectic. Any kind of movement will do, including shoveling snow.</li>
 	<li>Instead of meeting for drinks or a meal, go ice skating, snow-shoeing, sledding, or walk around and check out holiday window decorations.</li>
 	<li>Find more ways to be active from <a href=\"http://www.fitness.gov/be-active/ways-to-be-active/\">Fitness.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Stress Management</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Don’t stretch yourself too thin. Prioritize the most important tasks and events.</li>
 	<li>A gracious decline is better received that we imagine. Save yourself time, stress and calories with three easy words: \"No thank you,” “I have plans,” and “Thanks, but I’m full!\"</li>
</ul>
The holidays provide the temptation to over-consume and under-exercise. Physical activity helps reduces stress and compensate for eating too much. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/calories/index.html\">Balancing calories</a> is the key. Attacking holiday foods with reckless abandon will have long-term consequences. Conversely, trying to be “good” is a set up for failure. Feeling guilty for breaking a diet may dissuade us from returning to a healthy living plan after the holiday parties are over.

Those championing their benefits tend to focus on the effects e–cigarettes have on current smokers as compared to the effects of smoking traditional tobacco products. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-an-evidence-update\">Public Health England</a> seems to be leading the way for proponents of e–cigarettes and has stated that: “An expert review of the latest evidence concludes that e–cigarettes are around 95% safer than smoked tobacco and they can help smokers to quit.” Public Health England commissioned an independent review of the latest evidence and published its findings in, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/457102/Ecigarettes_an_evidence_update_A_report_commissioned_by_Public_Health_England_FINAL.pdf\">“E–cigarettes: an evidence update.”</a> This report appears to provide a fairly comprehensive summary of the arguments most proponents put forth advocating the benefits of e–cigarettes.

<strong>Some of its major findings include:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>That while e–cigarettes may not be completely safe, they contain far fewer harmful chemicals that cause smoking–related diseases in individuals who smoke traditional cigarettes, and the chemicals that are present pose only limited danger.</li>
 	<li>That e–cigarettes can be used to help individuals who smoke traditional cigarettes quit smoking and reduce their cigarette consumption and may even encourage individuals with no interest in quitting or reducing their cigarette consumption to do so.</li>
 	<li>That the accuracy of nicotine content labeling currently raises no major concerns. Packaging that was found to be poorly labeled—for the most part—contained less nicotine than stated on the packaging.</li>
 	<li>That despite recent studies that indicate the contrary, there is no indication that individuals who use e–cigarettes are exposed to dangerous levels of aldehydes.</li>
 	<li>That there is no evidence that e–cigarettes are undermining the long–term decline in cigarette smoking among adults and youth, and may in fact be contributing to it. Additionally despite e–cigarette experimentation by individuals who have never smoked, e–cigarettes rarely turn individuals who have never smoked into regular e–cigarette users.</li>
</ul>
Proponents on the other side of the debate have concerns about the long–term health effects of e–cigarette use as well as concerns that individuals who do not smoke—particularly children and adolescents—may take up e–cigarette use. They also believe that reports that e–cigarettes can help smokers quit are unsubstantiated.

<strong>For example:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>According to a comprehensive <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/gb/fctc/PDF/cop6/FCTC_COP6_10Rev1-en.pdf?ua=1\">report</a> by the WHO, “e–cigarettes have been marketed in almost 8,000 different flavours, and there is concern they will serve as a gateway to nicotine addiction and, ultimately, smoking, particularly for young people. Experimentation with e–cigarettes is increasing rapidly among adolescents, with e–cigarette use in this group doubling from 2008 to 2012.” The same report found that there is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether e–cigarettes can help smokers quit. And therefore, “smokers should first be encouraged to quit smoking and nicotine addiction by using a combination of already–approved treatments.”</li>
 	<li>According to the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm172906.htm\">FDA</a>, there is no conclusive scientific evidence that e–cigarettes promote successful long–term quitting. Additionally, there is not enough known about the amount of nicotine and other potentially–harmful ingredients being inhaled, nor the potential long–term risks associated with e–cigarette use.</li>
 	<li>According to the <a href=\"http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/50-years-of-progress/full-report.pdf\">Surgeon General</a>, while some individuals may be using e–cigarettes as a method to help them stop smoking (albeit an unproven method), the recreational use of e–cigarettes is becoming a concern, particularly among high school students whose e–cigarette use may establish a nicotine addiction.</li>
 	<li>Study results that appeared in <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2428954\"> “Association of Electronic Cigarette Use With Initiation of Combustible Tobacco Product Smoking in Early Adolescence,”</a> reported that students who had used e–cigarettes by the time they stared 9th grade were more likely than others to start smoking traditional cigarettes and other smoked tobacco products within the next year.</li>
 	<li>According to a recent <a href=\"http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2015/03/27/tobaccocontrol-2014-052175\">study</a>, published in the April 15, 2015 online <i>Tobacco Control</i>: “The concentrations of some flavour chemicals in e–cigarette fluids are sufficiently high for inhalation exposure by vaping to be of toxicological concern. Regulatory limits should be contemplated for levels of some of the more worrisome chemicals as well as for total flavour chemical levels. Ingredient labeling should also be required.”</li>
 	<li>According to the <a href=\"http://newsroom.heart.org/news/american-heart-association-issues-e-cigarette-recommendations?preview=fe7c\">American Heart Association</a>: “Based on the current evidence, the association’s position is that e–cigarettes that contain nicotine are tobacco products and should be subject to all laws that apply to these products. The association also calls for strong new regulations to prevent access, sales and marketing of e–cigarettes to youth, and for more research into the product’s health impact.”</li>
 	<li>According to the updated recommendations on smoking cessation published today by the <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation42\">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a>, there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of e–cigarettes as an aid in smoking cessation.</li>
</ul>
For now, there are far more questions than answers. Many potential health effects of e–cigarettes may only show up over the long-term rather than the short–term, and since e–cigarettes only entered the marketplace a decade ago they have not been around long enough or used widely enough to determine what those long–term effects might be. Further research must be done to fully understand the consequences of smoking e–cigarettes and whether or not they can be used successfully by individuals wanting to quit traditional cigarettes. However, due to the lack of definitive information about e–cigarettes, their use is not recommended.","Are E-cigarettes Beneficial or Harmful?","Learn about ecigarettes.","publish","open","open","","e-cigarettes","","","2017-07-20 16:18:49","2017-07-20 16:18:49","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/e-cigarettes/",0,"post","",0

CDC workers are being dispatched to this region in order to help contain the growing epidemic.

Medics on the frontlines of the outbreak are those at highest risk. A lead physician has died, and the disease has spread to healthcare workers. One American doctor and a Peace Corps volunteer afflicted with the disease were recently airlifted to the United States for treatment.
<h2>Ebola 101</h2>
The Ebola virus is one of several viruses causing a hemorrhagic fever. Ebola is transmitted to humans by infected primates; bats are suspected as the reservoir host. The disease spreads amongst humans through contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, vomit, urine, feces, and sweat.

Ebola symptoms include fever, muscle aches, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Bleeding manifestations of the disease include conjunctival hemorrhage, easy bruising, and bleeding from blood-draw sites. The fatality rate is approximately 60%. No effective medicines or vaccines to prevent the illness exist, and therefore treatment is only supportive. The incubation period varies from a few days to a few weeks, during which time an individual is not infectious.<img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/west_africa.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"west_africa\" align=\"left\" />

</ul>
<h2>Precautions</h2>
Medical personnel are isolating people who may have been in contact with the virus, as has occurred in New York City just this week. Airline passengers may be screened for Ebola before entry.

In general, prior to international travel, you should make an appointment for a travel consultation. An experienced nurse or physician with connections to global health databases and travel medicine websites can evaluate your needs, administer the recommended vaccinations, prescribe appropriate prophylactic medicines, and provide general counseling.

Schedule a travel health appointment about a month before your departure and bring prior vaccine records, along with a detailed itinerary. Recommendations will vary depending upon the areas being visited and the activities planned.

<strong>August Birthday Tea</strong>
Summertime in New York City can reach scorching temperatures and the high humidity can make it feel even hotter. Thankfully, EHE volunteers brought the perfect gift – Chilly Pad Cooling Towels by Frogg Toggs - to cool off in the NYC heat. One Hope Lodge guest expressed his gratitude with a smile and a chuckle \"Thank you so much for the gift. This will prepare me for the next heat wave.\" As the evening carried on, guests trickled into the lounge area that was filled with live soft piano music. Hope Lodge and EHE volunteers served guests moist chocolate cake, fresh fruit, sweet apple pie among other treats. Even during a heat wave, it is always a pleasant eventing for volunteers and guests at the Hope Lodge Birthday Teas.

<strong>July Birthday Tea</strong>
It's July and the outdoor patio is the perfect place to mingle and take in the NYC hustle and bustle below while, inside, the city sounds give way to calm and peaceful piano music and the sound of laughter. As usual, the evening kicks off with an abundance of hand-baked sweets on the dining table. EHE volunteers presented Hope Lodge guests with a treat for their feet – Under Amour (for men) or Balega (for women) socks to help keep them both active and comfortable. And, to top it all off, a magician was a surprise guest and delighted volunteers and guests alike during this special July Birthday Tea!

<strong>June Birthday Tea</strong>
June's Birthday Tea was quite a festive event. With the warmer weather, Hope Lodge guests relaxed on the outdoor patio and enjoyed the afternoon sun, the nice breeze and home-made baked goods by Hope Lodge volunteers. This month, EHE volunteers presented guests with the Bobble water bottle, a water bottle with a built-in filter. With the New York City humidity, it may not be pleasant traveling to and from treatments for patients and their caregivers. Having a refreshing drink of clean water provided by their Bobble water bottle will be a great way to cool things off. Many guests were delighted and couldn't wait to use it. The calm evening was a splendid way to celebrate the June Birthday Tea.

<strong>May Birthday Dinner</strong>
May 22, 2013 marked a very important milestone for the American Cancer Society (ACS) – their 100th birthday! Fellow centenarian EHE International had the honor of hosting a birthday dinner for Hope Lodge at their NYC location. Over 60 patients and their caregivers dined with volunteers and staff members from Hope Lodge and EHE International, including EHE president Deborah McKeever and Hope Lodge Senior Managing Executive Karen Radwin. The room was showered with balloons, confetti and gifts from ACS' wish list donated by EHE employees. Over dinner, individuals sang along to songs sung by EHE's own Mason Swearingen, shared stories of hope and created new memories together, enjoyed trivia and raffles and took photos with cut out posters of Derek Jeter and the Statue of Liberty. To top off the event, Pilar, a dedicated Hope Lodge volunteer and professional baker, baked not one but two scrumptious birthday cakes for the occasion. Here's to the next 100 years of amazing work by the ACS!

<strong>April Birthday Tea</strong>
April showers not only bring May flowers, they also keep people indoors. Luckily for the individuals staying at Hope Lodge, they have great company as EHE volunteers join the guests, Hope Lodge staff members and other volunteers to celebrate the April Birthday Tea. This month, Hope Lodge guests received a decorated envelope enclosed with a Barnes &amp; Noble gift card. As always, the dining table was completely full as guests, staff members and volunteers mingled and enjoyed an array delightful treats, including a spring themed cake!

<strong>April – Second Time Around Designer Sale</strong>
On Thursday, April 4th, the women of EHE attended Hope Lodge's second annual \"Second Time Around\" designer sale – a fundraiser to benefit Hope Lodge. Attendees browsed and found great prices on clothing, jewelry, shoes, etc., from top designers such as Valentino, DVF and Tory Burch. Excited attendees mingled over fine wine and hors d'oeuvres while comparing bargains. All for the love of fashion and Hope Lodge!

<strong>March Birthday Tea</strong>
March's celebration's gifts were cozy plush blankets - the perfect gift for a cold day and just in time to prepare for the snow storm that was approaching the next day. The soft blankets complemented the warm chicken noodle soup that was being served. It was a lively event that consisted of live piano music played by yet another talented volunteer, as well as fun activities such as knitting and a roomful of conversations. An EHE volunteer shared his experience about Hope Lodge's Birthday Tea: \"The love and friendship between patients, caregivers and volunteers made for a heart-warming experience that I will always remember.\"

<strong>February Birthday Tea</strong>
Kicking off the February Birthday Tea celebration, EHE volunteers surprised patients with lavish gift sets from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn. This month's Birthday Tea was filled with live piano music and a kitchen table full of treats, some of which are baked from ACS volunteers. One patient expressed his feelings about Hope Lodge to a volunteer and said, \"Traveling from so far away, I don't know what we would do without the Hope Lodge.\" It was a memorable afternoon for volunteers, patients and caregivers set to the sound of jazz standards impeccably performed by the talented volunteer at the piano.

<strong>January Birthday Tea</strong>
EHE and Hope Lodge kicked off the first Birthday Tea celebration of the year with home-baked pastries (including a delicious birthday cake by regular volunteer Pilar) and movie tickets for patients and their caregivers. A very special guest - Scooby the therapy dog - joined the event and brought joy to everyone in attendance. A special birthday cake, baked with love and care by a volunteer, along with the singing of \"Happy Birthday\" always brings cheer to patients and caregivers. All EHE volunteers were greatly impressed by the Hope Lodge – it truly is a place of hope.

By learning to accept and appreciate the body that you have, you can develop and maintain a healthy and positive body image.

<strong>Here are some tips for encouraging one to have a positive self-image of their body:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Focus on the many positive qualities, skills, and talents that you possess instead of focusing primarily on physical appearance. Appreciate and respect the entire you.</li>
 	<li>Recognize that there are certain aspects of your appearance that you can change and some that you cannot. Things such as height, shoe size, and bone structure cannot be changed and spending valuable time trying to change these features will prove fruitless and frustrating.</li>
 	<li>Prioritize good health rather than the attainment of a certain body weight, size, or shape. Decide to become physically active by performing activities that you enjoy, and decide to eat more nutritiously (but do so gradually as fad diets and sudden and severe diet restrictions are almost certain to backfire). Choose to live a healthier life and make changes gradually so that they can become life-long habits. As you begin to feel healthier and more energetic, your body image will also become more positive.</li>
 	<li>Avoid using food as a reward or punishment. Do not make certain foods forbidden, instead encourage and promote moderation.</li>
 	<li>Choose to be around positive, supportive people. Friends and family that support, value and accept you as you currently are can help to boost body image.</li>
 	<li>Replace negative self-talk with positive self-talk. Do not focus on perceived flaws. Instead, focus on thoughts that celebrate the amazing things that you do now and can/will do in the future.</li>
 	<li>Avoid alcohol, cigarettes and drugs. Self–medicating with these items may provide an easy escape from negative thoughts and feelings, but the relief will only be temporary. Issues and problems should not be avoided; they should be dealt with a clear mind.</li>
 	<li>For some individuals, the focus and constant worry about their weight or some other aspect of their body that they are dissatisfied with is more than they can deal with on their own. If you ever feel this way, it is important to seek professional help.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Bottom Line—For Your Health!</h3>
Many people spend an inordinate amount of time trying to change the way they look. Instead of experiencing the here and now and enjoying their life today, they put their lives on hold until they achieve some impossible “ideal.” Rather than trying to meet the impossible standards that are perceived to be expected in today’s culture, try to accept yourself as you are today. There is certainly no harm in trying to improve yourself, but learning to accept and appreciate yourself as you are today is the first step to a healthy, positive body image.

1418,1,"2014-12-18 19:14:42","2014-12-18 19:14:42","<h3>Companies that elevate employee wellness programs from a simple perk to a broader corporate mission—for every employee—will have greater success.</h3>
Faced with the dual challenge of health care costs, companies interested in improving their bottom line are focusing on disease prevention, improved fitness, weight-loss programs, and smoking cessation. “The earlier people address these issues, the less likely they are to actually get sick,” says Dee Edington, founder of the University of Michigan’s Health Management Research Center and chairman of consulting firm Edington Associates LLC. “It’s the best way to cut health care costs.”

A well-designed organizational and employee health program can also boost productivity, improve morale, and energize the workplace—putting companies, says Edington, at the next frontier in corporate strategy. Employee wellness programs actually predate health care reform, but their impact has been limited because of low participation. In a recent RAND Corporation study, 92% of companies with 200 or more employees offered employees a workplace wellness program, but less than 20% of employees chose to participate.

Why not? Companies offer wellness as a perk, but then fail to make it part of a shared vision of corporate values, says Deborah McKeever, president and COO of EHE International, a 101-year-old company that has pioneered corporate physical exams and employee health and lifestyle management programs.

“What’s important to the company becomes important to employees. It’s an expression of loyalty,” says McKeever. “Companies need to develop a unifying and credible vision that elevates health from simple perks to one of inclusion in the corporate mission statement”.

While some perks such as physical exams and personal trainers have traditionally been reserved for top management, companies would be wise to design inclusive benefits that extend to all employees. It starts with a physical exam for early detection and identification of risk factors for diabetes, hypertension, and other preventive conditions, stress reduction workshops, and work-life balance initiatives. Companies need to make these initiatives a corporate priority, with executives embracing wellness both for themselves and all employees. The role of the organizational climate must also be examined for a healthy and high-performing workforce to grow.

Current labor trends appear to be driving the push toward organizational health programs, as an improving economy makes it harder for companies to retain employees. The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that 2.5 million Americans voluntarily left their jobs in May, up from 2.2 million a year earlier. Of the 18% of workers who recently told employment website CareerBuilder that they’re dissatisfied with their work, 65% said they didn’t feel valued by their company. “Health is personal and no other employee benefit offering says ‘I care about you’ more than a robust wellness program,” says McKeever.

A shared-values approach sends a clear message that a company values its employees and is committed to their success. It is a message, Edington says, that resonates deeply with today’s workers, who were raised in a culture that values meaning and purpose as much, if not more, than financial success. “We are really on the edge of a sea change,” he says, noting that the conversation is shifting away from health care and focusing on health instead. “Health is a win-win organizational value.”

1420,1,"2015-10-27 19:14:45","2015-10-27 19:14:45","It's no secret that getting a great workout at the gym will make for a more healthy you, but what qualifies as a great workout? These days the answer appears to be lifting weights.

There is so much research that suggests that strength training is beneficial to health that it can essentially be considered a fact. Yet data acquired by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/earlyrelease201212_07.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centers for Disease and Control Prevention</a> from the National Health Interview Survey in 2012 has some interesting information: while close to 50 percent of females aged 18 and over met the 2008 federal physical guidelines for aerobic activity, when they included muscle-strengthening into the mix, the figure dropped to about 17 percent.

So what exactly is being done about this figure? Well for one there appears to be greater pushes for women to lift weights in the media (perform a Google search using “women strength training” and make sure to look at the images too). The body image ideals of the past (i.e., being very skinny) have since transitioned into more practical and accessible territory—which is to say that being healthy and embracing one’s natural body composition is in.

The fact of the matter is that curves and health go hand in hand with strength training. And the secret is starting to get out that lifting weights will not make you bulky. Getting a body building physique takes years of training, an overload of calories, and (specifically for women) a way to increase testosterone levels *ahem*
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health</h3>
Being in good health is attractive full stop. And nothing screams health more than having a great body. While running/jogging will help you lose weight, strength training will give you greater posture, curves, strength, and confidence. Men have been lifting weights from the beginning of time to help build their physical and psychological selves, now with the barriers of the past being torn down, an increasing number of women are reaping the same health benefits.

1421,1,"2016-09-12 19:14:48","2016-09-12 19:14:48","Energy drinks are produced by companies and brands such as Monster, Red Bull, Rock Star, Wired, Venom, Amp, NOS and 5–Hour Energy. These products typically claim to decrease fatigue while improving mental alertness, concentration, metabolism and overall performance.

Energy shots are simply smaller, concentrated versions of energy drinks. Both are easy to find in supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, sporting goods stores, gas stations and vending machines.

The two most common ingredients in energy drink products are caffeine and sugar.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Caffeine</strong>: <i>Caffeine</i> is a central nervous system stimulant and <i>diuretic</i> (a substance that helps to rid the body of fluids) that is naturally found in the leaves, seeds or fruits of over 60 plant species worldwide. Caffeine is commonly found in foods and beverages derived from coffee beans, cocoa beans, kola nuts and tea leaves. It can also be produced synthetically and added to foods, beverages, supplements and medications. After ingestion, caffeine is absorbed and passes quickly to the brain. It usually reaches its peak level in the blood within one hour and stays there for four to six hours. Caffeine does not collect in the bloodstream, nor is it stored in the body. It leaves the body through urine many hours after it has been consumed.</li>
 	<li><strong>Sugar</strong>: <i>Sugar</i> is a simple carbohydrate that supplies energy to the body. It is found in the food supply as either \"naturally–occurring sugar\" or \"added sugar.\" Naturally–occurring sugar is found in fruits, vegetables and dairy products, while added sugar is added to food products during processing. Added sugar contributes a large amount of calories to an individual’s diet while providing little to no nutritional benefit. Energy drink products contain added sugar.</li>
</ul>
Other ingredients are commonly included in energy drinks:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Guarana</strong>: <i>Guarana</i> is a South American plant. One seed of the guarana plant contains approximately twice as much caffeine as a coffee bean. Energy drink marketing language claims that guarana increases weight loss and improves energy and mental function though these claims are unsubstantiated.</li>
 	<li><strong>Taurine</strong>: <i>Taurine</i> is an amino acid produced naturally by the body, though the taurine that is added to energy drinks is synthetic. In its natural form, taurine is thought to help regulate salt and water in the blood and support neurological development. Marketing language claims that taurine improves metabolism and reduces fatigue during exercise though these claims are also unsubstantiated.</li>
 	<li><strong>B–vitamins</strong>: B–vitamins are added to many energy drinks with claims that they boost energy and mental and physical performance. However, all that individuals need to do to ensure adequate consumption of B–vitamins is consume a healthy, nutrient–rich, plant–based diet.</li>
</ul>
While the caffeine and sugar in energy drinks and energy shots may make you feel more alert temporarily, they can also lead to unwanted health effects.

1422,1,"2014-07-30 19:14:49","2014-07-30 19:14:49","A thorough examination and comprehensive set of preventive health screenings by medical experts will produce valuable data for your doctor; however, health care isn’t all a numbers game. Talk with your doctor to fully understand what the data charts mean in real-life terms to you. This is particularly critical when making medical or lifestyle decisions based on risk factors—whether to change your diet, go on medications, or have major surgery. Prevention is founded upon a dialogue where patients are active partners with doctors in developing their care.
<h3><strong>What to Expect from a Risk Assessment </strong></h3>
As the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/healthy_eating/fruits_vegetables.html?s_cid=tw_ob825\">CDC advises</a>, only trained doctors should perform examinations and evaluate your health status and risks. Provide your physician with as much information as possible about your current health issues (including any medical conditions or prescriptions), past health problems (even if no longer present), and family members’ health status (e.g., history of diabetes, breast cancer, or heart attacks). Your doctor should be very inquisitive, ask follow-up questions, and request previous medical records if needed.

A preventive health risk assessment should include a full physical examination, biometric screenings, blood draw, EKG, and other tests appropriate for your age, gender, and physical condition. A physician needs various types of information to create a complete picture of your physical condition. Based on established preventive health guidelines, this is what a sound examination looks like:

<h3>Be a Smart Health Information Consumer</h3>
Although you may feel uncomfortable talking about health issues, an open conversation with your doctor will help build a plan to protect your future health. There is no one-size-fits-all way to explain health risk. For instance, some people prefer percentage break downs (e.g., 10% chance of developing colon cancer), but this may not be right for you. Furthermore, a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/07/24/333719559/for-better-treatment-doctors-and-patients-share-the-decisions\">Massachusetts General Hospital study</a> found “only about 20 percent of the physicians said they were very comfortable using numbers and explaining probabilities to patients.\" Whether your doctor provides numerical specifics or speaks in a broad sense, you should ask questions, bring up concerns, and collaborate with your doctor in making lifestyle changes to lower your health risk.
<div></div>
Prior to a doctor visit, make a list of questions and concerns no matter how insignificant.

“Having some sort of written guidance can be very helpful,” notes EHE preventive health physician Dr. Gabriella Trotta-Barni. “Patients may become flustered and feel intimidated once they sit down with a doctor.”

Here is a helpful <a href=\"http://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/communicating_with_your_doctor/\">checklist for talking with your doctor</a>. Clear communication is the key to understanding your health risk and taking action.

Ok, well from the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm055436.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FDA</a>:?

<em>“Since the 1950s, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a number of steroid hormone drugs for use in beef cattle and sheep, including natural estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and their synthetic versions. These drugs increase the animals’ growth rate and the efficiency by which they convert the feed they eat into meat.”</em>

And a <a href=\"http://www.sustainabletable.org/258/hormones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sustainable Table article</a> referencing a <a href=\"http://www.phschool.com/science/science_news/articles/hormones_beef.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">source</a> claims that an “estimated 80 percent of all US feedlot cattle are injected with hormones”.

Additionally, the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm055435.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FDA</a> “approved a bST [bovine somatotropin] product in 1993 with the brand name “Posilac®” after determining that its use would be safe and effective. Posilac® is approved for over-the-counter use in dairy cows starting at around 2 months after the cow has a calf until the end of the lactation period.” From 2000 to 2005 <a href=\"http://www.agbioforum.org/v13n3/v13n3a04-gillespie.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">17 percent of dairy producers</a> had utilized Posilac® for their product.

So while these hormones are considered harmless to people—as stated by the FDA—the question is really at what levels? Since moderation is always the key when determining health benefits and detriments, if I drink milk everyday will I be more at risk for cancer? If I’m looking to gain muscle for sports or simply aesthetics, will increasing my consumption of beef disrupt my endocrine system? Are we simply saying that eating hormone-injected food is just like eating food not injected with hormones?
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
There are numerous studies on this issue, but a general consensus is yet to be determined as there are sources that site harmful effects from consuming food injected with hormones and others that hold that doing so is harmless. But in the big picture, consumers must know what’s in their food to make the best decision for them.

I like the idea of having a workout routine, but with a hectic schedule, it is the first thing that drops off of my calendar when a meeting/home repair service/doctor appointment pops up, which is regularly in my world.  So, I’m trying to do the best I can, and that’s just it, DO THE BEST YOU CAN.  You’ll surprise yourself.  Here are a couple of things I do to stay focused on a physical activity routine.

1425,1,"2014-11-21 19:14:54","2014-11-21 19:14:54","Employee wellness programs are increasingly popular in corporate America.

A <a href=\"http://www.fidelity.com/inside-fidelity/employer-services/health-care-survey-finds-spending\">National Business Group on Health survey</a> shows that spending on employee wellness programming increased by 15 percent in 2013 from the previous year, and the number of companies offering incentives for participation in such programs \"has increased from 57 percent in 2009 to 74 percent in 2014.\" These trends include growth in subsidized gym memberships and exercise programs. A focus on fitness makes sense for all involved.

Companies reap <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.chron.com/tax-incentives-companies-offer-gym-memberships-18505.html\">tax benefits</a> from fitness programs, and employees enjoy improved health outcomes by participating. A <a href=\"../../../../com/eheintl/www/programs.html\">healthy workforce</a> may also result in further savings for companies through lower healthcare costs.

<a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/workplacewellnessmarketreview2012.pdf\">A 2012 U.S. Department of Labor-commissioned study</a> reports that \"30 percent of all employers and 63 percent of large firms provided either gym membership discounts or on-site exercise facilities\" for employees. However, <a href=\"http://ohsonline.com/Articles/2013/09/01/Increasing-Employee-Participation-in-Corporate-Wellness-Programs.aspx?Page=1\">corporate incentives</a> alone may be enough to get some everyone to the gym. Many people struggle with motivation, scheduling, and knowing how to integrate exercise in their daily routine. The success of these fitness programs are defined by the employees who must take advantage of these benefits. One person’s motivation to go to the gym regularly is different from another.
<h3>Let’s Get Physical</h3>
Starting a physical activity regimen is easier with a gym membership. A gym's operating hours allow for a consistent exercise schedule regardless of weather, and a variety of equipment and activities help prevent boredom. If you have a membership, begin by planning workout times around your daily schedule. Develop your exercise plan based upon the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html\">Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</a>. In order to obtain health benefits, the Guidelines recommend adults perform the following:
<ul>
 	<li>2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (i.e., brisk walking) every week, plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that target all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).</li>
 	<li>OR 1 hour and 15 minutes (75 minutes) of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (i.e., jogging or running) every week, plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that target all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).</li>
 	<li>OR an equivalent mix of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity and muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week, plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that target all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).</li>
</ul>
As always, talk with a physician before you begin any new exercise program.
<h3>When a Gym Card Is Not Enough</h3>
Many of us struggle with finding the time and motivation to go to the gym regardless of a company discount and convenient access to a fitness center. It’s easy to make excuses. We convince ourselves we are too busy, too tired, or too bored with the gym. Many of us don’t see immediate results from exercise and give up. These fitness <a href=\"http://www.healthywomen.org/content/blog-entry/four-common-i-hate-exercise-excuses-debunked\">roadblocks can be overcome</a>. The most important thing to do is to just keep active. EHE health coaches recommend:
<ul>
 	<li>Finding a motivation that works for you</li>
 	<li>Setting realistic goals and push yourself</li>
 	<li>Trying different types of exercises thath fit your lifestyle</li>
 	<li>Changing it up to keep workouts dynamic and engaging</li>
 	<li>Going with a gym partner to help motivate you to put on the sweat pants</li>
 	<li>Joining a group exercise class</li>
</ul>
<h3>It Doesn’t Matter Where You Sweat</h3>
If you don’t have a gym membership, there are many ways to be active outside of a spinning class and without an expensive treadmill. <a href=\"http://acsm.org/about-acsm/media-room/news-releases/2011/08/01/acsm-issues-new-recommendations-on-quantity-and-quality-of-exercise\">The American College of Sports Medicine</a> recommends basic activities you can do almost anywhere:
<ul>
 	<li>Do flexibility exercises at least two or three days each week at home before or after work
<ul>
 	<li>Each stretch should be held for 10-30 seconds to the point of tightness or slight discomfort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Start exercises slowly and build time, intensity and frequency
<ul>
 	<li>Depending on your fitness level and lifestyle, beginning with 5-10 minutes a day and adding small increments each week may be more manageable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Perform various physical activities throughout the day for 10-20 minutes each
<ul>
 	<li>Take a walk after work, lift hand weights in your office during lunch, or walk up the stairs instead of using the elevator/escalator</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Build light, moderate, or vigorous physical activities into your life every day
<ul>
 	<li>Stand up and walk around while you talk on the phone</li>
 	<li>Walk to do local errands</li>
 	<li>Do chores the old fashion way, like garden work with a rake instead of leaf blower, use a broom instead of vacuum, and hand wash the car</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Except No Substitutions</h3>
The science on physical activity as a means to improve your health is well known in the medical field. From preventing <a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/285701.php?tw\">serious disease</a> to improving your <a href=\"http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-10-minutes-benefits-brain.html\">brain health</a>, exercise is an equal and integral component of healthy living along with proper diet. You can’t have one without the other. Fad diets and <a href=\"http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/28/5/330\">unproven trends like a \"polypill</a>\" should not be relied upon as a quick fix or substitute for a healthy lifestyle (but may be prescribed by physicians when necessary). To improve cardiovascular health and prevent disease, it’s simple: eat right and get moving. There are no alternatives to exercise. Ultimately, it is up to us to make fitness a priority in our lives.

\"We all know that we should be physically active because it’s good for us, but we may not know how good and in how many different ways it can be particularly beneficial,\" says EHE Health Coach Shereé Chambers.

\"Better than a pill or fad diet, being physically active can positively affect your life right now — from boosting your energy and mood, decreasing disease risk, and increasing lifespan, to improving your confidence, work performance, and sex life.\"

The question, of course, becomes \"why?\"

Why are people hard-pressed to achieve fitness when every voice out there is saying that it's good? Not only that, but it is equally ubiquitous to hear that not being fit is bad. So why?

An <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/are-you-programmed-to-enjoy-exercise/?ref=health\">article</a> in the NY Times poses an interesting answer: perhaps unfit people are simply not programmed to be fit.
Citing a study published in

the Journal of Physiology, the article summarizes the study by describing the findings. Essentially, rats that like to run on a wheel were bred with other rats that like to run on a wheel and they in turn produced rats that also like to run on a wheel. The opposite was true for rats that were not so inclined to run.

This difference in the rats is attributed to genes encouraging certain neurons in the brains of running rats to mature and develop the drive to run. The rats that weren't inclined to run showed considerably less mature neurons in their brains. But before we put down the dumbbell in nihilistic fashion, the study also showed that even some non-running rats ran reluctantly.

The professor that oversaw this study cautions that these findings shouldn't be attributed to people as the brains of rats and humans are different, and that \"people can decide to exercise\".

1427,1,"2015-07-09 19:14:58","2015-07-09 19:14:58","When it comes to food and mood, you are what you eat. We tend to soothe ourselves with foods that contain high levels of added fat, sodium, and/or sugar—among other things—when we’re feeling strained. In fact, our current mood is an often overlooked component of our health. In order to maintain one’s health, individuals should understand the relationship food has on their mood.
<h3><strong>How Food affects the Brain</strong></h3>
It is common knowledge that foods have a basic, physical effect on the body; for example, if you eat too much junk food then you will get fat, or if you don’t eat for a few days you will feel weak. But foods also play a significant role in brain function and by extension one’s mood.

A 2008 paper titled, “<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2805706/pdf/nihms162299.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brain foods: the effects of nutrients on brain function</a>,” published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience finds that hormones found in the stomach, specifically leptin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), insulin, and nutrients found in foods have been shown to influence cognition and emotion.

According to the paper, leptin is the hunger hormone that reduces one’s appetite (i.e. tells you when you are full) and “facilitates synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus,” which is responsible in strengthening our ability to learn and memorize new information. Ghrelin is a peptide hormone released from the stomach that raises one’s appetite and produces similar benefits as leptin. GLP1 regulates one’s metabolism and improves memory. Insulin is an essential hormone that is produced before, during, and after a meal and affects cognition. In addition, omega-3 fatty acids and micro-nutrients such as iron, zinc, folate, and vitamins A through E were shown to affect “neural pathways that are associated with synaptic plasticity.”

These findings present a biological connection between food and the brain, and the necessity of providing the brain with the right kinds of food. When it comes to eating, the hormones in the stomach work with the brain in order to regulate when we eat and stop eating when we feel full. But many foods eaten today (i.e. refined, processed, and packaged foods) can actually make you feel hungry (i.e. not full) cause insulin levels to spike. In an article titled “

<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/07/29/11-foods-that-make-hungrier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">11 foods that make you hungrier</a>,” the author lists many commonly consumed foods that studies show cause hunger by reducing leptin and spiking insulin. As the hormones in the stomach affect learning and memory, foods that constantly make us feel hungry or give us a quick boost of energy (all while lacking essential nutrients) eventually influence our brains into seeing them in an overwhelmingly positive light.

When a food tastes bad or makes us feel sick, we begin to form negative associations with that food. This is a basic biological function that has helped people stay away from consuming things that were harmful to them, such as poison which can also be found in certain kinds of berries and mushrooms. But when a food tastes good and makes us feel energetic , we form positive associations. These foods taste good and make us feel energetic. And in the case of foods that reduces leptin production and spikes insulin levels, hormones shown to affect learning and memory, the positive association gets promoted to borderline addiction. Refined, packaged, and processed foods cause cravings, anticipation, highs, and then lows—an emotional roller coaster.
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
The “Brain foods” paper concludes that: “Brain networks that are associated with the control of feeding are intimately associated with those that are involved in processing emotions, reward and cognition.” What this means is that food affects your brain on a neurological level. Healthy foods form positive associations that lead to better health and peace of mind. Refined, packaged, and processed foods form positive associations that lead to cravings and emotional mood swings, typically compounded by the fact that these foods also lead to obesity and other issues. Don’t reward good behavior with junk, and don’t allow negative feedback to occur if you’ve cheated on your diet. The consequences of these actions are more significant than just feeling bad.

An expiration date does not relieve a firm from this obligation. A product that is dangerous to consumers is subject to potential action by the FDA to remove it from commerce regardless of any date printed on a label.
<!--more--></span>

According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), \"open dating\" is the process of displaying a calendar date (as opposed to a code) on a food product in order to help stores determine the length of time to display a product for sale and allow the consumer to make purchase decisions based on freshness and quality. It is not a safety date. When a calendar date is used, both the month and day of the month must be stated. In the case of shelf–stable foods (foods that can be safely stored at room temperature; i.e., on the shelf) and frozen products, the year must also be expressed. Additionally, when a date is displayed on a product, there must be a phrase explaining the meaning of that date such as \"sell–by\" or \"use before.\" immediately adjacent to the date. What do these different phrases mean?

<strong>According to the USDA:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>A <strong>\"sell–by\"</strong> date informs a store of the length of time to display a product for sale. Consumers should purchase such products before this date.</li>
 	<li>A <strong>\"best if used by (or before)\"</strong> date is a recommendation pertaining to the product’s optimal flavor or quality. It is not a purchase or safety recommendation.</li>
 	<li>A <strong>\"use–by\"</strong> date is the suggested last date that the product will be at peak quality. The date has been determined by the manufacturer of the product.</li>
 	<li>A <strong>\"closed or coded date\"</strong> is a packing number used by the manufacturer.</li>
</ul>
These dates are indications of optimum quality as deemed by the manufacturer rather than safety recommendations. Both the FDA and the USDA agree that, even if a use–by date expires during home storage, a product should still be safe, wholesome and of good quality for a period of time beyond the date if handled properly and kept at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below.

As with medications, proper storage is critical to the integrity and shelf life of food. The mishandling and/or improper storage of food can cause food–borne bacteria to grow and result in illness <i>before or after</i> the date displayed on a package.

<strong>The USDA recommends that consumers follow these tips:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>When shopping, refrigerated or frozen items should be selected after non–perishable items.</li>
 	<li>Meat or poultry in packaging that is torn or leaking should never be purchased. Products should be purchased prior to their expiration date.</li>
 	<li>Perishable food items should be brought home immediately after purchase and refrigerated within 2 hours (1 hour when the temperature is above 90° F).</li>
 	<li>The temperature of the refrigerator and freezer should be checked with an appliance thermometer.</li>
 	<li>The refrigerator should be at or below forty degrees Fahrenheit and the freezer at or below zero degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
 	<li>Handling recommendations that are listed on the product should be followed.</li>
 	<li>Perishable food such as meat and poultry should be wrapped securely to maintain quality and to prevent meat juices from contaminating other foods.</li>
 	<li>Fresh poultry, fish, ground meats and variety meats should be cooked or frozen within two days; other beef, veal, lamb or pork should be cooked or frozen within three to five days.</li>
 	<li>Products should be frozen if they cannot be used within the appropriate time period.</li>
 	<li>Once a perishable product is frozen, it does not matter if its date expires; foods that are kept continuously frozen are safe indefinitely.</li>
 	<li>To maintain quality when freezing meat and poultry in its original package, the package should be wrapped again with foil or plastic wrap.</li>

If the freshness of a food item is questionable, common sense should prevail. Consumers must judge the freshness and edibility of their food themselves. The best way to do so is by using the senses, namely smell and sight. Before an expired product (or any product for that matter) is consumed, it should be checked for mold, odor or any other indication that the item might be contaminated. Food that develops an off odor, flavor or appearance due to spoilage should be discarded.","Food Expiration and Safety","Understanding food expiration dates","publish","open","open","","food-expiration-and-safety","","","2017-07-20 16:21:09","2017-07-20 16:21:09","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/food-expiration-and-safety/",0,"post","",0
1429,1,"2015-12-30 19:15:01","2015-12-30 19:15:01","Back in June of this year, the Journal of the American Medical Association released some <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2338262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interesting news</a>: The <em>2015 Dietary Guidelines</em> would lift the ban on dietary fat—previously the recommendation was to have no more than 35 percent of calories in one’s diet coming from fat.

This change comes partially from the behavior of substitution and how simplifying problems typically lead to more problems with greater complexity.

According to the article, since “fat contains about twice the calories per gram as carbohydrate or protein, it was also reasoned that low-fat diets would help prevent obesity, a growing public health concern.”

So to challenge obesity, low-fat and low-calorie products became the norm; however, these products substituted dietary fat for refined calories and added sugar.

Substituted things are typically not of the same quality as the thing they are substituting, and such is the case with products that tried to substitute fat. Rather than lowering obesity and the risk for cardiovascular disease, low-fat products ironically increased these numbers because everything boiled down to getting total fat to zero on the nutrition label.

Obesity is a complex problem that has numerous causes working with each other to create the epidemic that still continues to this day. Even if an individual were to eat what is considered a healthy diet, this by itself won’t change everything. Indeed, those who go from one unhealthy practice to a healthy one might substitute another unhealthy practice for the one that they gave up, yet the substituted practice is actually worse than the one before it.

<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1592\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/donuts_substitution_20151230.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth215ampnamedonuts_substitution_20151230.jpg\" alt=\"donuts_substitution\" width=\"300\" height=\"352\" />For example, a person decides to substitute cakes and other desserts with fruit in an effort to curb added sugars and fat. But because there is a void in this person’s sweet tooth rather than eat sugar he/she will drink them instead as his/her consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages rise. This makes the problem worse because now the individual is actually consuming more added sugar than before, but considers it to be ok because he/she has stopped eating desserts.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
When it comes to your health there is no substitution. Processed and refined foods will always take a back seat to those that are unprocessed and unrefined, such as whole fruits, vegetables, and grains.

Looking healthy and vital, however, is not something that we have to buy. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and proper medical care are the best ways to slow the aging process.

Living well is its own proverbial fountain of youth.
<h3>Oxygen: Can’t Live With It and Can't Live Without It</h3>
In the 1950s, Dr. Denham Harman developed the scientific understanding of “free radicals” as the cause of aging. Basically, “<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/finding-the-fountain-of-youth/\">the theory says</a> a byproduct of oxygen use is adverse chemical reactions in cells. The result is aging and, ultimately, death.” We can slow the production of free radicals by staying fit and eating right. We can also limit the production of new free radicals by avoiding excessive smoking and drinking. However, aging is not something that can be stopped altogether. It is a natural process of living organisms.
<h3>Active Equals Younger</h3>
Although aging is not fully understood by science, a new study published in the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.2014.282863/abstract\">Journal of Physiology</a> is adding to the growing body of knowledge regarding the role of fitness in the aging process. Researchers evaluated older adults who were avid cyclists compared to a sedentary group.

“Active older people resemble much younger people physiologically,” writes the <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/how-exercise-keeps-us-young/?ref=health\">New York Times</a>’ Gretchen Reynolds. “The findings suggest that many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is, to a large degree, up to us.”

<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-3213\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cyclists.jpg\" alt=\"cyclists\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />Medical science has long understood the <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429905.300-exercise-may-be-the-best-antiageing-pill.html#.VK6keXtIaM8\">health benefits of exercise</a> in preventing bone and muscle loss, especially in older adults. Further <a href=\"http://tf.hu/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Rad%C3%A1k-Zsolt-NTK-41.pdf\">medical research</a> has examined the ability of regular exercise to “beneficially affect and retard biological aging.” The evidence points to consistent exercise as the most effective tool for remaining youthful and preventing the onset of aging (as much as biologically possible).

\"If you had to pick one thing, one single thing that came closest to the fountain of youth,\" says James Fries, M.D., a pioneer researcher on healthy aging at Stanford University in an <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/health/fitness/info-01-2011/the_real_fountain_of_youth.html\">AARP article</a>, \"then it would have to be exercise.\"

There are <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/31/anti-aging-exercises_n_3678467.html\">certain exercises</a> you can do to help resist aging. As with any new fitness routine, seek advice from your physician first. Until the fountain of youth is discovered, we have the tools for staying young in our own hands by simply exercising and living a healthy lifestyle. Ponce de Leon is not required.

1432,1,"2014-04-14 19:15:06","2014-04-14 19:15:06","Does meal frequency matter? If so, what is the healthiest eating pattern? Three square meals a day? Two big meals? Six small meals? Grazing throughout the day? No eating after 7:00 p.m.?

The truth is that such eating patterns can have an impact on weight and overall health, but this impact is limited and is closely related to other dietary factors.
<h3>Common Eating Patterns</h3>
While there are proponents of a great variety of eating patterns, two of the most common are \"three meals a day\" and \"small, frequent meals throughout the day.\"
<h3>Three Meals a Day</h3>
Conventional wisdom has long held that the \"three square meals a day\" (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) eating pattern is the optimal pattern for health, energy, and weight management. Recent research does in fact confirm a number of benefits related to this pattern.

A study published in the November 2011 <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22027056\">Journal of the American Dietetic Association</a> found that the consumption of three meals a day along with two snacks was associated with better long–term weight loss maintenance than other patterns. Another study by the <a href=\"http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2012/1206-eating-fewer-larger-meals-may-prove-healthier-for-obese-women/\">University of Missouri</a>, lead by Tim Heden, in 2012 found that the consumption of less frequent, larger meals may be “more advantageous metabolically” for obese women. In the study, the blood fat levels of eight obese women were measured on two occasions — after eating three meals and after eating six meals. Results showed that blood fat levels were lower when the women consumed three meals compared to six.

Finally, in another study published in Obesity in March 2011, <a href=\"http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2011/110330CampbellPork.html\">Purdue University</a> researchers found that, “Eating fewer, regular-sized meals with higher amounts of lean protein can make one feel more full than eating smaller, more frequent meals”. The researchers also found that eating more frequently had relatively no beneficial impact on appetite control. The larger meals led to reduced appetites, and people felt satiated. Researchers emphasize that the three larger meals were restricted in calories and reflected appropriate portion sizes for weight loss.
<h3>Smaller, More Frequent Meals</h3>
Many individuals believe that eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day raises metabolism and helps to keep it raised, thereby helping individuals to lose or maintain weight. The fact is, however, that food intake has only a small impact on basal metabolism, and individuals who consume more calories in order to increase metabolism will end up with a net gain in calories rather than a deficit. EHE’s Jeff Novick offers the following example: the increase in metabolism during food digestion amounts to only 10 to 15 percent of the calories ingested. Therefore, if an individual consumes a 300–calorie snack, he or she may \"burn\" 30 to 45 calories more than he or she would without the snack, but would also end up with a net gain of 255 to 270 calories. Taking in a net of 255 to 270 calories to raise metabolism by 30 calories would not be beneficial in regard to energy balance.

Additionally, the perceived weight loss benefits related to this eating pattern are not supported by scientific evidence. Researchers from the School of Human Kinetics at the University of Ottawa conducted a study of meal frequency that was published in the 2010 <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19943985\">British Journal of Nutrition</a>. Sixteen obese men and women participated in the study. Researchers found that, when individuals consumed the same amount of overall calories, there was no weight loss advantage to eating more frequent meals versus less frequent meals.

While this eating pattern does not offer any real benefit in terms of metabolism or weight loss, it can be an effective means of avoiding feelings of extreme hunger that can lead to overindulgence and the gain of additional weight. However, that effectiveness can easily be negated if an individual does not control portions and/or consumes several meals containing foods that are calorie dense.
<h3>Fasting Patterns</h3>
There are many additional eating patterns, each with its proponents and detractors. Some eating patterns that have recently gained popularity involve fasting and/or short–term food deprivation to aid in weight loss. However, such eating patterns are not proven to be effective methods of losing weight. In a study published in the February 2013 edition of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693571/\">NeuroImage</a>, researchers found that weight loss efforts are more successful when individuals consume healthy, low–fat/low–sugar foods during regular meals instead of going for long periods of time without any caloric intake. Another study published in the June 24, 2013 edition of <a href=\"http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1685889\">The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Internal Medicine</a> found that individuals who were practicing short–term food deprivation (i.e., skipping meals) bought 31 percent more high–calorie foods when grocery shopping.
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
According to Jeff Novick, in light of the toxic food environment in the U.S., the frequency and timing of an individual’s meals are much less important than the types of foods consumed. In fact, when an individual adheres to a nutrient–rich, lower–calorie–dense diet, eating patterns are not as important as there is little danger of overeating. Conversely, if an individual is consuming processed foods that are calorie–dense and nutrient–poor, he or she is much more likely to gain weight regardless of eating pattern.

This brings up a very interesting issue: how does being a woman affect one’s health? The answer, according to MedlinePlus, is quite significantly. With October designated as “Breast Cancer Awareness Month,” the parade of pink ribbons should serve as a reminder that women must take their overall health seriously.

Medline Plus states that, “Women have unique health issues. And some of the health issues that affect both men and women can affect women differently.” These unique health issues involve being pregnant, going through menopause, and being at greater risk for certain conditions—namely breast cancer and osteoporosis.

In addition to unique health problems for women, MedlinePlus states that:
<ul>
 	<li>\"Women are more likely to die following a heart attack than men</li>
 	<li>Women are more likely to show signs of depression and anxiety than men</li>
 	<li>The effects of sexually transmitted diseases can be more serious in women</li>

As this is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, getting a mammography screen—particularly in middle aged women—is important; but more important is for all women to take a step back and evaluate their overall health.

Ask yourself: Am I getting enough vitamins and nutrients in my diet? Do I exercise regularly? Have I had a pap test done? Am I heart healthy? Am I considering getting pregnant? Am I already pregnant, and if so have I visited a midwife or obstetrician? Am I approaching menopause?

1434,1,"2015-05-26 19:15:10","2015-05-26 19:15:10","This second “Maintaining Health…” blog is all about what we consume and understanding the value of our diets. By developing a deeper understanding of the role of food in our lives, we will be better prepared to make decisions that benefit our health.
<h3><strong>Making Your Diet Trend Towards Healthy </strong></h3>
In <a href=\"../../../../com/eheintl/www/blog/maintaininghealth.html\">part 1</a>, it was stated that a healthy diet places emphasis on <em>“reducing and/or eliminating the intake of refined, processed, and packaged foods and moving toward an unrefined, unprocessed plant–based diet that is centered on fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables, intact whole grains and legumes.”</em> If one were to take a closer look at the quote, “reducing and/or eliminating the intake of refined, processed, and packaged foods” is really the key element as these are the foods that undermine our health, providing little-to-no nutritional value while contributing excessive calories to the diet.
<h3><strong>Refined Grains and Added Sugar</strong></h3>
There are two types of grains: whole grains and refined grains. According to <a href=\"http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/grains.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">choosemyplate.gov</a>, “Whole grains contain the entire grain kernel ― the bran, germ, and endosperm. <strong>Examples of whole grains include</strong> whole-wheat flour, bulgur (cracked wheat), oatmeal, whole cornmeal, and brown rice. Refined grains have been milled, a process that removes the bran and germ. This is done to give grains a finer texture and improve their shelf life, but it also removes dietary fiber, iron, and many B vitamins. <strong>Some examples of refined grain products are</strong> white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice.”

When we consume a refined grain, we are consuming calories without obtaining as many nutrients with all the benefits of the whole grain. Studies show that consumption of whole grains can help to protect individuals from developing many chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. People who regularly consume whole grains also tend to have lower cholesterol levels and are less prone to obesity. Whole grain snacks include low–fat whole–grain crackers, breads, pretzels and cereals. To snack the right way, individuals should look for food items that are labeled \"100% whole grain\" and are low in salt, sugar and fat.

Added sugar is another major problem in the common American diet, equally as insidious as refined grains but potentially more <a href=\"http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/sugar-problem/refined-sugar-the-sweetest-poison-of-all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">harmful</a>. According to the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyDietGoals/Sugar-101_UCM_306024_Article.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Heart Association (AHA)</a>, added sugar can be found in: “soft drinks, sugars, candy, cakes, cookies, pies and fruit drinks (fruitades and fruit punch); dairy desserts and milk products (ice cream, sweetened yogurt and sweetened milk); and other grains (cinnamon toast and honey-nut waffles).”

Additionally, added sugar goes by many names on a food’s nutrition label, such as: “brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, fruit juice concentrates, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, malt sugar, molasses, raw sugar, sugar, sugar molecules ending in “ose” (dextrose, fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, sucrose), and syrup.”

There is naturally-occurring sugar found in fruits (which is made up of both glucose and ‘fructose’) and milk (where the sugar is made up of ‘lactose’). While the chemical structures of naturally–occurring sugars and added sugars are identical, there is an important difference. <a href=\"http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/DietaryGuidelines2010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010</em></a>, whole foods that naturally contain sugars also naturally contain vitamins, minerals, fiber, water, and other essential nutrients — all of which contribute to \"diluting\" the concentration of sugar in the food. These foods and beverages include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, dairy products, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds that are prepared without added sugars, starches, solid fats, and sodium. These foods are high in nutrients (nutrient–dense) and low in calories. Foods and beverages that contain excessive amounts of added sugar, on the other hand, are not as nutritionally beneficial. Where there is added sugar, there are more calories but not more nutritional value. Items with added sugars are thus energy–dense and nutrient–poor — the overall calorie density of the food increases while the overall nutrient density decreases.

According to the <a href=\"http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/dietary_guidelines_for_americans/PolicyDoc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Guidelines</a> and a <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1849985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent study</a>, added sugar accounts for between 10 and 16 percent of the total calories in the average American diet. This number is far too high, especially when considering that for most individuals to meet their nutritional needs while staying within their calorie limits, the maximum percentage of calories from added sugar should not exceed 5 to 10 percent of total calories.
<h3><strong>Processed Foods</strong></h3>
Foods that are processed have been altered in some way to aid in consumption or distribution; and while this isn’t inherently bad, according the <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/goodfood/pages/what-are-processed-foods.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Health Service (NHS)</a>, these foods may (and typically) contain added salt, sugar, and fat. While it is possible to consume these items in moderation, the problem is that so many foods are processed that it is very easy for people to exceed the recommended limits of salt, sugar, and fat.
<h3><strong>Packaged Foods</strong></h3>
These foods are, as the name implies, packaged for convenience. They are similar to processed foods in that most packaged foods are altered in some way for distribution. And like processed foods, packaged foods aren’t inherently bad if your diet is low in added salt, sugars, and fats, or if the packaged food is simply whole food chopped and organized to fit in a box. However, packaged foods are listed in this article as many of them go the processed route and are modified with additives.

But seeing as many foods need to be packaged, <a href=\"http://www.prevention.com/food/smart-shopping/smart-shopping-21-healthy-prepared-foods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> is a list of healthy packaged foods. The idea is to find those that are least-processed and have minimal amounts of additives.
<h3><strong>The Value of a Nutritious Diet</strong></h3>
More than any other component, what we put inside our bodies <a href=\"http://www.fitness.gov/eat-healthy/why-is-it-important/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">determines</a> the trajectory of our health. According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, the most common health risk behaviors for chronic illnesses are: “lack of exercise or physical activity, poor nutrition, tobacco use, and and drinking too much alcohol.” As one may observe, three out of the four health risk behaviors involve things that enter the body.

Now, abstaining from tobacco and limiting alcohol, while hard for some who’ve developed a habit, are pretty straightforward. Also, getting off the couch and walking around the block isn’t something that requires planning or foresight. Eating, on the other hand, is something that has to take place multiple times a day for survival, which leads to the crux of the health issue: while everybody must eat, individuals must be knowledgeable about their food choices in order to eat <em>healthy</em>.

1435,1,"2017-01-17 19:15:11","2017-01-17 19:15:11","2017 is here and millions of Americans are reflecting on the personal changes that they want (or need) to make this year. Popular resolutions include vowing to lose weight, eat healthier, reduce stress, exercise more or quit smoking.

There is just one problem: while all of this sounds good in January, many of us lose our resolve and our resolutions are long forgotten and abandoned by April.

The simple truth is that New Year’s resolutions are easier to make than they are to keep because changing behaviors, particularly those that are long-standing habits, is easier said than done. Wanting to change is not enough. Success with a resolution demands more than wishful thinking; it requires patience, planning, and organization. The good news it is that it can be done!

<!--more-->

Many organizations recommend using the S.M.A.R.T. criteria to reach your goals and make lasting change. The acronym has several variations that are all similar. For our purposes we will use: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Specific:</strong> The first step in moving toward change is to be very specific about what you want to achieve. Avoid vague, noncommittal resolutions to \"lose weight\" or \"eat healthier\" or \"get out of debt.\" These goals are all too ambiguous and, therefore, are rarely successful. For example, rather than deciding you want to lose weight, decide how much weight you want to lose and in what time frame. Be specific.</li>
 	<li><strong>Measurable:</strong> When you are specific about the change you want to make, you can break it down into smaller specific goals that can be accomplished — and tracked — on a daily or weekly basis. This allows you to measure your progress. If you’re trying to lose a specific amount of weight, a reasonable and healthy goal is to aim to lose one-to-two pounds per week. You could do that by planning out and tracking how many calories you will eat each day and how many minutes of physical activity you will do each day. Then you will be able to concretely monitor your progress and measure your successes and shortcomings and make adjustments accordingly.</li>
 	<li><strong>Achievable:</strong> To make a lasting change the goals you set need to be reasonable and achievable. Setting a goal that requires little effort usually offers little motivation, but setting a goal that will be extremely difficult or even impossible to reach may be even more discouraging. The change you want to make should be challenging enough to motivate you, but not so challenging that you become frustrated because you may not possess the skills or resources to attain the goal. For example, quitting smoking cold turkey is not usually successful. Substituting nicotine gum for cigarettes on a regular schedule is much more likely to succeed. Regularly meeting realistic, achievable, short–term goals helps to build successful habits, makes continuing to work toward the change easier, and is psychologically rewarding.</li>
 	<li><strong>Relevant:</strong> While many of us can most likely name a number of things we would like to change and improve in our lives, it is important to remember that trying to make too many changes at once will almost certainly lead to failure. Instead, think about the change that would have the most meaning and impact in your life and start with that. If it is a change you’ve tried to make before but were unsuccessful, it is important to think about and pinpoint the root cause(s) of what has held you back in the past so you can shift away from the negative thoughts and behaviors that led to failure and instead choose your thoughts and behaviors wisely and deliberately so you can successfully change.</li>
 	<li><strong>Time-based:</strong>Setting a timeline to achieve a major change may be unrealistic if the change will require a long-term commitment, however, it is certainly possible to pick a date and time to start the process. It is also possible to pick timeframes for your shorter-term goals that are the stepping stones to reaching the larger goal. Whatever the change, you must also make time in your schedule to work on it. If the change is to exercise regularly, you need to schedule specific days and times to workout. If it is to improve your diet, you must schedule time to plan healthy meals for the week ahead and to shop for the necessary items. If it is to quit smoking, you must schedule breaks in your daily routine to help combat the stress that comes with nicotine withdrawal.</li>
</ul>
It is also important that you anticipate setbacks from time to time and plan for them. If, for example, you have a big vacation planned or know that your family is planning a big, fabulous meal for a holiday, maybe that is a week that you need to adjust your schedule. There is no sense setting yourself up for failure; if you know that a particular week is going to be hard, acknowledge that and adjust your plan accordingly. Of course, you should not give yourself every other week off, but a reasonable amount of slack is appropriate.

Whatever your New Year’s resolutions are this year, remember that there are different ways to go about achieving your goals. It may take you several attempts using several different methods to reach your goals. For many people, this trial and error is often discouraging, causing them to give up. It is, therefore, important to continue moving toward your goal, to try new techniques and find ways to stay motivated. Set small, attainable goals and reward yourself appropriately when achieving each one. Experts say that setting up a reward system is an excellent strategy to help you stick to a long–term goal. Perhaps the most important thing to do is to only make New Year’s resolutions that are truly important to you and that you will be motivated to achieve. Making a lasting change in behavior is rarely a simple process and will likely entail a substantial commitment of time, effort and emotion. But where there’s a will there’s a way and you can successfully achieve lasting change!","How To Make Lasting Change","How to make lasting change.","publish","open","open","","how-to-make-lasting-change","","","2017-07-20 16:14:20","2017-07-20 16:14:20","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/how-to-make-lasting-change/",0,"post","",0

In order to achieve optimal health and well–being, one’s digestive health must not be overlooked. Develop habits today that will help to improve and maintain your body''s digestive health.

<strong>There are important steps that individuals can take to improve and/or maintain digestive health:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Do not smoke</strong>: Smoking can harm all parts of the digestive system. Smoking increases an individual’s risk of developing Crohn’s disease, damages his or her liver and may contribute to the development of gallstones. Smoking also weakens the lower esophageal sphincter which can exacerbate gastroesophogeal reflux. Research has shown that people who smoke cigarettes are also more likely to develop an ulcer.</li>
 	<li><strong>Consume a balanced diet</strong>: Commitment to a healthy diet is one of the most important components of an individual’s overall health and well being. A diet that is considered to be ‘healthy’ is one that limits the intake of sodium, saturated fats, added sugars and sweeteners, solid fats and refined grains. It also emphasizes foods that are low in calorie density and high in nutrient density such as plant–based foods (i.e., fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables, intact whole grains and legumes) and lean proteins. With a plant–based diet, fiber intake is high and saturated fat intake is typically low. Fiber is essential because it eases the passage of food through the digestive tract, and helps to prevent a number of conditions including GERD, IBS, obesity and diverticulitis. Fluid consumption — especially water — is also very important. Water helps to dissolve nutrients, encourages passage of waste through the digestive system and helps to soften stools.</li>
 	<li><strong>Engage in regular physical activity</strong>: Regular physical activity helps to strengthen the muscles of the abdomen and stimulates the intestinal muscles to push digestive contents through the digestive system. Regular physical activity also helps to ward off constipation and other problems such as weight gain and stress.</li>
 	<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight</strong>: Obesity is linked to a number of digestive problems such as GERD, hemorrhoids and even esophageal cancer. By losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight, individuals can prevent many digestive issues.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reduce stress</strong>: When individual is under stress, his or her digestion process can slow down and bloating, pain and constipation may result. The individual may need to empty his or her bowels frequently, and the stools may be more loose and watery. Stress can also exacerbate conditions such as peptic ulcers and IBS. In order to reduce stress, individuals should engage in regular exercise, enjoy adequate amounts of sleep and adhere to a healthy diet. There are many stress management techniques that can also be utilized such as deep breathing or visualization exercises, meditation, yoga, massage, hypnotherapy and/or counseling.</li>
 	<li><strong>Take necessary medication(s)</strong>: In general, medications are only used when symptoms have not adequately responded to more conservative measures such as dietary changes and stress management. Individuals should consult a physician to determine if medication is appropriate.</li>

1437,1,"2016-08-09 19:15:15","2016-08-09 19:15:15","Poor oral and dental hygiene can lead to a variety of ailments including tooth decay, bad breath, gingivitis, and periodontal (gum) disease. According to recent research, however, there may also be a connection between an individual’s oral health and his or her overall health.

Poor oral and dental health may increase an individual’s risk of developing other serious health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke.

The practice of good oral hygiene may therefore be more than just an important component of an individual’s oral and dental health; it may also be a key element of his or her overall preventive health regimen.
<!--more-->

Good oral hygiene and oral health are not difficult to attain. The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends that individuals brush their teeth, floss, visit a dentist regularly, and consume a healthy diet.

<strong>Brush Teeth</strong>: Teeth should be brushed twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste and soft–bristled tooth brush. A tooth brush should be replaced every three or four months or sooner if the bristles are frayed. According to the <a href=\"http://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/b/brushing-your-teeth\">ADA</a>, the proper method for brushing teeth is as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>\"Place your toothbrush at a 45–degree angle to the gums.</li>
 	<li>Gently move the brush back and forth in short (tooth–wide) strokes.</li>
 	<li>Brush the outer surfaces, the inner surfaces, and the chewing surfaces of the teeth.</li>
 	<li>To clean the inside surfaces of the front teeth, tilt the brush vertically and make several up–and–down strokes.</li>
 	<li>Brush your tongue to remove bacteria and keep your breath fresh.\"</li>
</ul>
<strong>Floss</strong>: The <a href=\"http://www.ada.org/en/science-research/ada-seal-of-acceptance/product-category-information/floss-and-other-interdental-cleaners\">ADA</a> recommends that individuals floss between their teeth once a day. Flossing helps to remove plaque and food particles in places that a toothbrush cannot reach (between the teeth and under the gum line). While it is okay to brush before flossing or vice–versa, choosing to floss before brushing the teeth may allow fluoride from the toothpaste to reach between teeth more effectively.

<strong>Schedule regular dental checkups</strong>: Regular visits to the dentist for a checkup and professional cleaning are important because a dentist can detect oral health problems early and help to prevent oral health problems altogether. Additionally, it is important for an individual to let the dentist know about any changes in overall health because a number of medical conditions can also affect oral health. Each individual should consult with his or her dentist to determine the appropriate frequency of visits.

<strong>Consume a healthy diet</strong>: Adherence to a healthy diet is an important factor in oral health. According to the <a href=\"http://www.eatright.org/About/Content.aspx?id=8384\">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</a>, an individual’s food choices can \"affect the development and integrity of the oral cavity and progression of oral diseases.\" The Academy’s position statement on oral health and nutrition states:
<ul>
 	<li>\"It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that nutrition is an integral component of oral health. The Academy supports integration of oral health with nutrition services, education and research. Collaboration between dietetics practitioners and oral health care professionals is recommended for oral health promotion and disease prevention and intervention.\"</li>
</ul>
A ‘healthy’ diet is one that reduces and/or eliminates the intake of refined, processed, and packaged foods, and emphasizes the consumption of unrefined and unprocessed plant–based foods such as fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables, intact whole grains, and legumes.","How Do I Attain Good Oral Hygiene?","Tips for improved oral health","publish","open","open","","how_do_i_attain_good_oral_hygiene","","","2017-07-20 20:57:48","2017-07-20 20:57:48","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/how_do_i_attain_good_oral_hygiene/",0,"post","",0
1438,1,"2016-06-21 19:15:16","2016-06-21 19:15:16","Anyone who has been inactive and has not exercised for some time should begin a running program slowly. According to <a href=\"http://www.runnersworld.com/the-starting-line/start-running\">RunnersWorld.com</a>, the website for Runner’s World magazine, before starting a running routine it is important for an individual to be able to do some form of regular exercise such as walking for at least 30 minutes a day four or five days per week for at least two weeks. Then, it is advisable to begin adding short spurts of running to the walking routine, gradually building up the length and amount of time spent running until only short bouts of walking are necessary. RunnersWorld.com recommends gradually building up the length of time spent walking and running by no more than 10 percent each week.

Patience is essential. Some people try to do too much too soon and quit before having a chance to experience the rewards of improved fitness. The body needs to adjust to the strain of running or any new physical activity. As the body adjusts, the duration and intensity of running can be increased gradually. Taking breaks to walk when building a running routine is important as it will help prevent injury and prevent an individual from doing too much too soon. Pay attention to signals that the body sends when running. Pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and nausea all signal that it is time to take a break. Exercise should not hurt. Mild soreness may occur but any exercise that causes sharp or continuous pain should be discontinued until the individual has a chance to consult with a doctor.

Overall, the frequency, length, type, and intensity of a running program should be determined by an individual’s fitness goals, fitness level, age, health, skills, interest, and convenience. If an individual is satisfied with a running routine that allows him or her to run comfortably for two miles a day five days a week, then that will satisfy the <a href=\"http://acsm.org/about-acsm/media-room/news-releases/2011/08/01/acsm-issues-new-recommendations-on-quantity-and-quality-of-exercise\">guidelines</a> for physical activity. However, it is also possible for an individual to reap greater benefits by running longer and more often. According to <a href=\"http://health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/chapter4.aspx\">2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</a>, increasing the length and amount of time spent being physically active will result in even greater health benefits.

It is important to note that individuals who are starting an exercise routine for the first time or who have pre–existing health conditions or disabilities should consult with their physician before starting a running program. Such individuals will also likely benefit from a consultation with a trained fitness professional who can design an individualized program that takes all such needs into account.
<h3>What is the Bottom Line?</h3>
The key to any running program, whether it be running a couple of miles a day a few days a week, or running in marathons, is to listen to your body. Pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and nausea all signal that it is time to take a break. Exercise should not hurt. Mild soreness may occur but any exercise that causes sharp or continuous pain should be discontinued until you have a chance to consult with a doctor. Pushing through the pain and adhering to the “no pain, no gain” mantra can result in serious injury that could sideline you for a long time. The fact is that trusting your body and listening to its signals, can help prevent many unnecessary injuries. This can keep you on track for making running a regular and permanent habit that will allow you to reap the benefits of good health for many years.

1439,1,"2016-06-15 19:15:17","2016-06-15 19:15:17","The term <i>cognition</i> encompasses mental processes related to attention, learning, memory and language as well as executive functions such as decision–making, goal–setting, planning and judgment.

When an individual loses the ability to carry out these processes and/or perform these functions, <i>cognitive impairment</i> (also referred to as \"cognitive decline\" or \"cognitive deficit\") is said to occur.

Cognitive impairment currently affects approximately 16 million Americans. However, this number is expected to rise dramatically as the number of Americans aged 65 and older increases in the coming years.
<h3>Prevention</h3>
While there is no conclusive proof to support any particular course of action to prevent the development of cognitive impairment, researchers have found evidence that some risk factors can be modified
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cardiovascular risk factors</strong>: Like the heart, the brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients from the blood to work properly. There is now overwhelming evidence that suggests that the same lifestyle and dietary factors that contribute to heart disease also increase an individual’s risk of developing dementia and age–related cognitive impairment. Therefore, \"managing numbers\" — cholesterol levels, blood pressure and blood sugar — is vital as improving cardiovascular health may also reduce one’s risk of developing dementia.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cholesterol levels</strong>: Excess cholesterol in the blood is dangerous as it can build up on the walls of the arteries and harden into plaque. The plaque can then cause a narrowing and/or blockage in the arteries that restricts the flow of blood and oxygen. When blood vessels in the brain become hardened, narrowed or damaged, brain cells can become damaged and die, resulting in <i>vascular dementia</i>. The most common cause of elevated cholesterol levels is a diet that is high in saturated fats, trans–fatty acids and dietary cholesterol (i.e., red meats, eggs, dairy products and fried and processed foods). Individuals can control high blood cholesterol by: adhering to a healthy diet that limits fat and cholesterol intake; consuming only enough calories to achieve or maintain a healthy weight; performing regular physical activity; increasing soluble fiber in the diet (e.g., oatmeal, beans and apples); avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol consumption; and by consuming cholesterol–lowering foods that are rich in soluble fiber (i.e., fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans).</li>
 	<li><strong>Blood pressure</strong>: High blood pressure (140/90 mmHg or higher) appears to be associated with an increased risk of the development of both vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease and is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure and kidney disease. When an individual has high blood pressure, the heart must work harder to move blood throughout the body. Most individuals can control blood pressure by adhering to a healthy diet, performing regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol consumption.</li>
 	<li><strong>Blood sugar</strong>: Over time, high blood glucose levels (<i>hyperglycemia</i>) can damage nerves and blood vessels, thereby increasing an individual’s risk of developing dementia. Individuals with hyperglycemia or diabetes must carefully control their blood glucose levels through proper nutrition, daily physical exercise, loss of excess weight, monitoring of daily blood glucose levels and adherence to any prescribed medication regimen. Additionally, individuals with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered to the body each day by either a pump or an injection. Some people with type 2 diabetes may also need insulin therapy to control their blood glucose. According to research results published in the August 13, 2013 edition of <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>, higher glucose levels may be a risk factor for dementia, even in individuals without diabetes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Smoking</strong>: A number of studies have found that smokers who are middle aged and older may have an increased risk of developing dementia. Smoking is also a major risk factor for heart disease. Studies have shown, however, that when an individual quits smoking, his or her heart rate and blood pressure begin to return to normal and many other risk factors for heart disease show improvement.</li>
 	<li><strong>Alcohol consumption</strong>: Existing data is inconsistent and a definitive assessment of the relationship between alcohol use and dementia is not yet possible, but evidence increasingly suggests that light–to–moderate drinking may be protective against the onset of dementia. However, no one should begin drinking or drink more frequently based upon potential and inconclusive health benefits. The possible health benefits of moderate alcohol consumption apply only to moderate consumption and never to heavy drinking. Heavy and/or excessive drinking is a known risk factor for the development of dementia.</li>
 	<li><strong>Physical fitness</strong>: Numerous studies have found a link between the performance of physical activity and improved cognitive function. According to the results of a study published in the December 2012 issue of <i>Stroke</i>, regular physical activity may decrease an individual’s risk of developing dementia by 40 percent, and may decrease the risk of a decline in thinking skills by as much as 60 percent. The researchers suggest that individuals (particularly individuals with vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, stroke or diabetes) participate in moderate–intensity physical activity for at least 30 minutes three times a week to prevent cognitive impairment. Regular physical activity increases blood flow and oxygen to the brain, and increases the levels of brain chemicals that encourage the growth of nerve cells. Additionally, the performance of aerobic activity has been linked to enhanced memory skills, while moderately–strenuous physical activity is strongly associated with healthy brain aging.</li>
 	<li><strong>Diet</strong>: The consumption of a balanced, heart–healthy diet that is low in fat, rich in fruits, vegetables, antioxidants and omega–3 fatty acids has been linked to improved cognition.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mental fitness</strong>: When an individual exercises his or her brain by learning new things or pursuing activities that are intellectually stimulating, brain–cell networks may be strengthened. Recent studies have found that people who engage more frequently in activities that involve significant information processing have a much lower incidence of dementia.</li>
 	<li><strong>Stress management</strong>: When stress is chronic or unmitigated, it can damage the brain and impair memory. When faced with a serious stressor, the brain triggers the adrenal glands to release powerful stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Repeated or long–term exposure to these hormones is toxic to nerve cells in the hippocampus. While the goal of eliminating stress entirely from life is unrealistic, it is important for an individual to learn effective coping strategies.</li>
 	<li><strong>Social engagement</strong>: Numerous studies have shown that staying socially connected is an important aspect of cognitive health and may help protect against cognitive impairment and dementia. Conversely, social isolation is associated with numerous health problems and a shorter lifespan. Social activity is also closely linked to feelings of \"self–efficacy,\" the sense that one’s actions make a difference and that life has meaning. The reasons are not entirely clear, but some experts believe that self–efficacy may be related to a greater resilience to stress.</li>
 	<li><strong>Adequate sleep</strong>: A growing body of evidence suggests that a full night of restful sleep is critical for memory consolidation and the ability to retain information. In studies, people who are deprived of sleep generally score significantly worse on memory and cognitive tests, and the deficits may not be reversible even after the participants resume restful sleep.</li>
 	<li><strong>Underlying health problems</strong>: Certain causes of cognitive impairment are related to treatable health issues such as medication side effects, vitamin B12 deficiency and depression. It is important for individuals with an underlying medical problem to receive proper medical attention and treatment.</li>
 	<li><strong>Head trauma</strong>: Some studies have shown a link between moderate, severe and repeated mild traumatic brain injuries and an increased risk of AD or other forms of dementia years after the original head injury(s). Individuals can prevent head trauma by wearing a seat belt, using a helmet when participating in sports and by \"fall–proofing\" their homes.</li>

When the knees are healthy, individuals are able to perform tasks with ease and participate in a wide range of activities. When the knees are damaged, however, even the simplest tasks can seem very difficult. This article will focus on ways to prevent knee injury.

<strong>While not all knee conditions can be prevented, there are steps that individuals can take to reduce their risk:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight</strong>: Overweight and obesity places increased pressure and stress on the knees and increases an individual’s risk of ligament and tendon injuries as well as osteoarthritis. Individuals can reduce their risk of developing osteoarthritis — or lessen severity of symptoms if already diagnosed — by maintaining a healthy weight or by losing weight if overweight or obese.</li>
 	<li><strong>Exercise regularly</strong>: Exercises that are designed to strengthen the quadriceps and hamstrings are vital to the health of the knees as weak muscles are a leading cause of knee injury. Balance and stability training will also help the muscles around the knees to work together more effectively. As individuals strengthen their muscles with exercise, they will also strengthen their bones. It is important for individuals suffering from chronic knee pain or osteoarthritis to consult a healthcare professional before beginning an exercise regimen as high–impact activities should likely be avoided in favor of swimming, water aerobics or other low–impact exercises.</li>
 	<li><strong>Warm up and cool down</strong>: It is important to warm up and cool down before and after working out by performing walking, bending and stretching exercises to reduce the risk of injury. By stretching the quadriceps muscles and hamstrings, an individual can reduce tension on the tendons and relieve pressure on the knee during physical activity.</li>
 	<li><strong>Wear proper footwear</strong>: To maintain balance and leg alignment, individuals should wear shoes that fit properly, are in good condition and are appropriate for the activity being performed. Most experts recommend that individuals purchase new athletic shoes every three months or after 500 miles of wear. Individuals suffering from flat or overpronated feet (feet that roll inward) can wear special shoe inserts (orthotics) to help alleviate these problems.</li>
 	<li><strong>Wear protective gear</strong>: Individuals should wear protective equipment such as kneepads and shin guards as appropriate when participating in sports or other activities.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pay attention to signals</strong>: Pain signals that it is time to take a break. Exercise should not hurt. Mild soreness may occur, but any exercise that causes sharp or continuous pain should be discontinued until an individual can consult a physician.</li>
</ul>
Healthy knees are essential for mobility and the performance of a wide variety of functions. When the knees are unhealthy, relatively simple actions like walking across the room, climbing stairs and getting in and out of the car can all become a challenge. Take the steps now to take proper care of your knees so that you can maintain or improve your lifestyle and enjoy a healthy and active life.

1441,1,"2016-06-01 19:15:20","2016-06-01 19:15:20","Sleep needs are largely individual — some people can thrive with less sleep than others. However, different age groups generally require different amounts of sleep. Babies need up to 18 hours of sleep each day, while most adults require 7 to 9 hours. However, the <a href=\"https://sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/sleepinamericapoll/SIAP_2011_Summary_of_Findings.pdf\">2011 Sleep in America</a> poll conducted by the National Sleep Foundation revealed that 63 percent of adult Americans sleep less than 7 hours a night, and 15 percent sleep less than 6 hours on weeknights.

Inadequate sleep can take a toll on an individual’s mind, body and overall health. It can lead to drowsiness, poor concentration, impaired memory, impaired physical performance, irritability and mood swings. The CDC has also found that long-term insufficient sleep is associated with a number of chronic diseases and conditions including high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression and increased mortality. A lack of sleep is not only associated with the onset of these diseases, it may also complicate their management and outcomes.

Individuals are exhibiting signs and symptoms of inadequate sleep when they are:
<ul>
 	<li>Having difficulty getting out of bed in the morning</li>
 	<li>Feeling sluggish in the afternoon</li>
 	<li>Feeling irritable or moody</li>
 	<li>Having difficulty concentrating</li>
 	<li>Having difficulty staying focused and alert in meetings or classes</li>
 	<li>Needing to nap to get through the day</li>
 	<li>Falling asleep while watching TV or relaxing in the evening</li>
 	<li>Routinely falling asleep within five minutes of lying down</li>
</ul>
A physician should be consulted if these symptoms are routinely present. When an individual feels that he or she is sleeping for an adequate period of time but still experiences these symptoms, a sleep disorder may be affecting quality of sleep. The quality of sleep is just as important as the quantity - an individual whose sleep is frequently interrupted or cut short is not getting quality sleep.
<h3>What is the Bottom Line?</h3>
Sleep health should be seen as being just as important as mental and physical health; after all, it plays a key role in both. Avoid neglecting your sleep when you are busy and then ‘catching up’ when you have more free time. Make your sleep health a priority by practicing proper sleep habits every day.

<ul>
 	<li>Making sleep a priority by keeping a consistent bedtime and waking schedule, seven days a week</li>
 	<li>Ensuring that the bedroom is pleasant and conducive to sleep by keeping it dark, quiet, comfortable and cool (computers, televisions and work materials should be kept out of the bedroom and the discussion of emotional issues with a partner should be avoided before sleep)</li>
 	<li>Creating a bedtime routine that is relaxing (e.g., reading a book or listening to soothing music before sleep) • Exercising at least three hours before bed (such exercise can help an individual to fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly)</li>
 	<li>Avoiding caffeine and nicotine for four to six hours before bedtime (the stimulating effects of caffeine in coffee, colas, teas and chocolate can take as long as eight hours to wear off fully)</li>
 	<li>Recognizing the effects of alcohol (while it may help an individual to fall asleep faster, alcohol disrupts sleep after a few hours as the body begins to metabolize the alcohol)</li>
 	<li>Finishing dinner several hours before bed and avoiding foods that cause indigestion</li>
 	<li>Balancing fluid intake so that thirst is quenched for the night, but fluid intake is not so great that an individual must wake up during the night to urinate</li>
 	<li>Avoiding daytime naps (if an individual feels that he or she must nap, the nap should be kept short and occur before 5:00 p.m.)</li>
 	<li>Getting enough exposure to natural light (individuals should try to be exposed to natural sunlight for at least 30 minutes each day and, if possible, wake up with the sun shining or use very bright lights in the morning)</li>
 	<li>Going to sleep when truly tired and not forcing sleep (if an individual cannot fall asleep after 20 minutes, he or she should get up, go to another room, and do something relaxing such as reading or listening to soothing music until tired enough to get back into bed and fall asleep)</li>
</ul>

1443,1,"2016-08-07 19:15:25","2016-08-07 19:15:25","Many fast food and full service restaurant meals have extremely high levels of calories, saturated fat, salt, and sugar. According to the <a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/977761/eib-105.pdf\">American Heart Association (AHA)</a>, one of the main reasons for this may be that portion sizes in fast food and sit–down restaurants have grown considerably over the last 40 years, with portions often being double or triple the standard recommended serving sizes. Additionally, Americans are eating out more often than they used to.

According to the article, <a href=\"http://www.cspinet.org/nah/xtreme2014.html\">\"Xtreme Eating 2014\"</a>, several popular restaurant chains offer entrees with alarming total calorie counts (ranging from almost 2,000 to over 3,000 calories), saturated fat content (from 30 to 93 grams), sodium content (from 1,370 to 7,620 milligrams), and sugar content (14 to 24 teaspoons). Of course, these unhealthy meals are at the extreme end of the spectrum, and many restaurants and fast food chains do offer healthier options. These numbers do, however, highlight the need for individuals to be informed and take extra care when dining out. For example, many individuals assume that meals in a full service restaurant are somehow healthier than fast food meals. That does not appear to be the case. According to a study in <a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8776812&amp;fileId=S136898001200122X\"><i>Public Health Nutrition</i></a>, main entrées had significantly more fat and saturated fat in family style restaurants than in fast food restaurants.
<h3>The Good News</h3>
Fortunately, it is not all bad news when it comes to eating out. With some extra effort and advance preparation, it is possible to enjoy meals that are a part of a healthy diet at full service restaurants and fast food establishments.

According to the <a href=\"http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/dietaryguidelines2010.pdf\"><i>Guidelines...</i></a>, the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/DiningOut/Deciphering-the-Menu_UCM_301469_Article.jsp\">AHA</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-eating-out.html\">ChooseMyPlate.gov</a>, individuals can:
<ul>
 	<li>Check nutrition information online before choosing a restaurant or fast food establishment to dine at. In addition to the websites of the restaurants themselves, there are a variety of websites that can steer individuals in the direction of restaurants with healthy options.</li>
 	<li>Select smaller portion sizes (e.g., appetizer or side dish) instead of an entrée.</li>
 	<li>Share a meal with a friend.</li>
 	<li>Have the server set aside and wrap half of the meal \"to–go\" before serving it at the table.</li>
 	<li>Avoid foods on the menu with the following words: \"creamy\", \"au gratin\", \"crispy\", \"scalloped\", \"fried\", \"breaded\", \"battered\", \"stuffed\", or \"buttered.\"</li>
 	<li>Order food that is steamed, broiled, baked, grilled, poached or roasted.</li>
 	<li>Order syrups, dressings, and sauces on the side (and use sparingly).</li>
 	<li>Eat slowly, and pay attention to signals from the body. When an individual feels full, it is time to stop eating.</li>
 	<li>Ask the server how a meal is prepared and what ingredients are used. Do not be afraid to ask that changes be made in meal preparation (e.g., no added salt), or to change a menu item from fried to grilled or steamed. Additionally, it is okay to ask that an unhealthy side dish such as French fries is replaced with steamed vegetables or a tossed salad (with dressing on the side).</li>
 	<li>Decline any bread, rolls, popcorn, or tortilla chips that are delivered to the table prior to the meal.</li>
 	<li>Begin the meal with a broth–based soup and/or a salad with dressing on the side, as that often leads to eating fewer calories throughout the remainder of the meal.</li>
 	<li>Avoid high–sugar, high–calorie beverages and ask for a glass of water instead.</li>
</ul>
These are just a few suggestions that can make eating out an enjoyable <i>and</i> healthy experience.","How Unhealthy is Eating Outside Food?","Information on eating outside foot.","publish","open","open","","how_unhealthy_is_eating_outside_food","","","2017-07-21 04:07:59","2017-07-21 04:07:59","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/how_unhealthy_is_eating_outside_food/",0,"post","",0
1444,1,"2016-07-11 19:15:26","2016-07-11 19:15:26","A regular physical examination is a vital tool for the assessment of an individual’s current health and for the early detection of preventable diseases. The exam also provides an opportunity for an individual and his or her doctor to develop a personalized health plan that focuses on healthy lifestyle choices and appropriate behavior modifications.

While it can be easy to forego exams, especially when one is feeling healthy, the power of exams to help individuals live longer, healthier lives should not be underestimated.
<h3>Why Have Regular Physical Exams?</h3>
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), all adults — even seemingly healthy ones — should undergo regular physical examinations at their healthcare provider’s recommended frequency. When an individual has regular exams, his or her physician can compare measurements of weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and body mass index (BMI) over the years and address changes as needed.

<strong>Regular physical exams also provide the following key benefits:</strong>

<strong>Disease screening</strong>. Screening tests play a major role in the exam process. Even before risk factors are identified and/or symptoms are recognized, screening tests help to detect diseases in their early, most treatable stages and can even prevent disease. Many conditions and diseases are highly treatable when detected early. Without screenings, however, many conditions will go unnoticed because they do not produce symptoms until a critical level is reached. High blood pressure, for instance, is a silent disease that does not exhibit symptoms. Yet over time, high blood pressure can cause more and more damage to every part of the body. Similarly, high blood sugar and high cholesterol levels typically do not produce symptoms until advanced stages.

Preventive screenings are performed for dozens of health issues and typically follow age and gender–specific guidelines. Such guidelines can be confusing however, as recommendations may vary between organizations and may change as new information becomes available. While general guidelines can provide a ‘ballpark estimate’ of what to be screened for and when, it is important for all individuals to develop a partnership with a knowledgeable healthcare provider who can personalize screening recommendations according to each patient’s unique needs. In addition to finding disease in an early, treatable stage, the results of screening tests can help people to take steps to manage risk factors and reduce the likelihood that they will develop a life–threatening disease or disabling condition.

<strong>Assessment of risk factors</strong>. Lifestyle behaviors, family health history and measurements of blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol and glucose levels are all important indicators of an individual’s risk of developing certain medical conditions. Lifestyle behaviors such as diet, activity level, safe sex practices, stress level and drug, alcohol and tobacco use should all be discussed candidly during the exam. Family history can influence the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and various cancers. Any new conditions or diseases that have occurred in an individual’s family since his or her last physical exam should be discussed. It is imperative that individuals provide the most up–to–date and truthful information to their doctor in order to receive the most accurate assessment.

<strong>Lifestyle modification</strong>. Achieving a healthy weight, maintaining an active lifestyle, consuming a healthy diet with adequate fruits and vegetables, getting enough sleep, avoiding or minimizing alcohol intake and not smoking are behaviors that have been proven to be essential to a long and healthy life. Physicians can address these behaviors with patients and both parties can then discuss related changes, opportunities and obstacles. For example, when a physician tells a patient that he or she needs to lose weight, it is important that the physician explains why it is necessary and helps the patient understand the consequences of overweight and obesity. The patient will gain more knowledge about the ways in which overweight or obesity affects his or her health, and can then work with the physician to develop a plan for making necessary changes.

<strong>Vaccination updates</strong>. It is important for individuals to receive recommended immunizations to protect against serious, preventable diseases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are a significant number of illnesses, disabilities and deaths that result from diseases that could easily have been prevented by vaccination. Specific immunization recommendations depend on a number of factors including age, lifestyle, high–risk conditions, type and locations of travel and previous immunizations, so it is important that each individual discusses his or her personal vaccination plan with a physician.

<strong>Physician/patient relationship</strong>. The most important part of a physical exam is the exchange of information between an individual and his or her doctor. Individuals should prepare for a physical exam ahead of time by collecting important information for the doctor including a list of questions and current concerns, a list of changes that have occurred since the last exam (including changes in family health history) and a list of current medications and supplements that they are taking. It is important for all individuals to develop a partnership with a knowledgeable and trusted healthcare provider who can effectively discuss medical questions and concerns. When a trusting relationship is formed, individuals are more likely to visit their doctor when they are ill and are more likely to comply with the doctor’s orders in general.

The best way to prolong life is to take measures to prevent illness whenever possible. Having regular physical exams and leading a healthy lifestyle are the two most important preventive measures that you can control. If it is time for your regular physical exam, make your health a priority and schedule your exam today.

Being quick, having good recall, and delaying mental fatigue are all benefits of a brain-healthy lifestyle, and these improvements essentially make you “smarter” since enhanced mental faculties lead to enhanced mental performance.

According to the <a href=\"https://dana.org/StayingSharpSuccessfulAging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dana Foundation</a>, the following exercises and activities promote a brain-healthy lifestyle.
<h3>Exercise the body:</h3>
The performance of physical activity closely related to cognitive function. There have been countless studies over the past few years that have shown that regular exercise promotes health. Exercise increases the levels of brain chemicals that encourage the growth of nerve cells. The performance of aerobic activity has been linked to enhanced memory skills, while moderately strenuous physical activity is strongly associated with healthy brain aging. Exercise the mind: When an individual exercises his or her brain by learning new things or pursuing activities that are intellectually stimulating, brain-cell networks may be strengthened. Recent studies have found that people who engage more frequently in activities that involve significant information processing have a much lower incidence of Alzheimer’s disease. Such activities include reading newspapers, playing challenging games like Scrabble® and going to museums. Additionally, longer formal education is associated with mental sharpness among older people, possibly because continued learning creates a neural reserve of denser, stronger nerve-cell connections that increase the brain’s ability to compensate for age-related changes in neural structure and function.
<h3>Eat a healthy diet:</h3>
The consumption of a balanced diet that is rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids has been linked to improved cognitive fitness. Additionally, a diet that is rich in whole grains such as brown rice and whole wheat bread or pasta supports overall cardiovascular health, which is closely linked to mental health.
<h3>Get adequate sleep:</h3>
A growing body of evidence suggests that a full night of restful sleep is critical for memory consolidation and ability to retain information. In studies, people who are deprived of sleep generally score significantly worse on memory and cognitive tests, and the deficits may not be reversible even after the participants are allowed to sleep.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
Scientists are making tremendous progress in studying cognitive fitness and understanding the degree to which you can influence the state of your brain. Although many questions remain, the hope is to learn how and why lifestyle choices and activities directly affect the brain. For now, it is encouraging to know that you can do many things every day that may help to improve your cognitive fitness – now and in the future.

1446,1,"2016-01-06 19:15:29","2016-01-06 19:15:29","Living a healthy life is big on everyone’s radar from getting more sleep, to eating a nutritious diet, and doing enough exercise. But the New Year’s resolution trial period always seems to end at around two weeks. So this post will offer some tips on how to stay in the game for all four quarters and reap the rewards of finishing off a year in the ascension.
<h3>Planning to Suceed</h3>
One of the first things that individuals should do for a healthy life is plan for it. And while making a to-do list is nice and all, it doesn’t always get it done when it’s time. No, a real plan involves knowing what is holding you back from your health goals at the start and having things in place that keep you going when times get rough.

An easy and common obstacle that many people fail to overcome is holiday get-togethers. While Thanksgiving and Christmas are far off, they will inevitably come around meaning that the reverie that prevails with being around family, friends, and food will block out a lot of the discipline that it takes to remain focused on health. Massive amounts of sodium, calories, alcohol, and other things will be consumed by many who feel entitled to being unhealthy, but that shouldn’t be you…and it won’t if you plan.
<h3>Don't Undervalue the Short Game</h3>
Looking ahead is a way for adults to put themselves in a favorable position. In fact, those who fail or simply don’t bother to look ahead are generally criticized as needing to mature. But to get to tomorrow you must live today.

Any change takes time to make into a habit, and with health it takes even longer to see positive outcomes. Instead of giving up or tapering off after an unknown time, individuals should focus their New Year’s health-related resolutions on the day-to-day. If you’ve made a plan to get healthy and know what it takes then completing those objectives everyday will ensure that you get to the end of the year with progress made.
<h3>Mindset Determines Trajectory</h3>
The biggest pitfall for New Year’s health-related resolutions is the reward aspect. Many people feel like they should reward themselves for doing good. This is an extremely slippery slope as once unhealthy habits—habits that have been formed for years—start gaining acceptance, whether it’s once a year, once a month, or once a day then the doors are open for it to become part of one’s lifestyle. The sacrifice of going without and knowing that the change has lasted one more day should be the reward, and while it is excruciating at first, the longer an individual delays gratification the more likely that delay becomes the reward in and of itself.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
As the song in the musical goes, “Change never comes easy.” New Year’s resolutions have been broken by so many people so many times that it has become a farce. This is unacceptable as a resolution requires resolve. If your resolution this year is to live a healthy lifestyle then you must plan ahead, live day-to-day, and let the work you put towards your goals be its own reward.

1447,1,"2016-04-26 19:15:31","2016-04-26 19:15:31","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), older adults who are at risk of falling should perform balance exercises at least three days a week. Balance training can be as simple as standing on one foot for a few seconds, and then gradually increasing the length of time for more difficulty.

Individuals should begin by holding on to a sturdy chair for support, and in time try it without holding on. From there individuals may progress to standing with one foot in front of the other to alter the base of support, and then shifting their body weight in different directions and alternate lifting the feet from the floor. Other balance exercises include backward walking, sideways walking, heel walking, toe walking and standing from a sitting position. Tai chi, a form of martial arts developed in China, has also been shown to improve balance.

While balance training is vital for fall prevention programs, any exercise that preserves bone mass, and improves endurance, muscle strength and flexibility, also helps to prevent falls and related injuries. In fact, exercise, in general, can and should be a part of everyday life for older adults. While the type and level of activity can vary greatly depending on an individual’s abilities, the fact that everyone benefits from some form of exercise is undisputed by medical experts. One of the most noticeable effects of exercise among older adults is an increase in mobility and independence. Exercise increases mobility by decreasing body weight, increasing strength and reducing joint stiffness. As joints experience less pain and an increased range of motion, movements such as walking or performing basic tasks around the house become easier, thus increasing independence.
<h3>The Bottom Line—For Your Health!</h3>
According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/falls/adultfalls.html\">CDC</a>, many people who have fallen, even if they are uninjured, develop a fear of falling. This fear can cause some individuals to limit their activities, which leads to reduced mobility and decreased physical fitness, which in turn increases their actual risk of falling. Fortunately, falls and fall-related injuries are not an inevitable part of growing older. Older adults can help maintain their independence and decrease their risk of falling by exercising regularly and focusing on balance and strength training exercises designed to decrease their chances of falling.

As the saying goes, getting to the top (becoming healthy) can ultimately be the easy part when all is said and done; staying on top (maintaining one’s health for life) is the hard part.

Before we worry about staying at the top, however, let’s get there first. Let’s start by becoming un-unhealthy!

It’s no secret that America faces a health problem; the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/psr/npao/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> reports that: <em>“During 2009–2010, approximately 17% of children and adolescents and 36% of adults were obese.”</em>

The causes of this health problem are known:

<em>“Poor diet and physical inactivity contribute to many serious and costly health conditions, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, unhealthy cholesterol levels, and high blood pressure.”</em>

And since a poor diet and physical inactivity are the root causes of general health problems, it would follow that a <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs394/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">healthy diet</a> and <a href=\"http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/pa/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">physical activity</a> are the solutions.

In regard to a healthy diet, EHE International’s diet and nutrition expert Jeff Novick recommends:

<em>“A well–balanced diet with emphasis on reducing and/or eliminating the intake of refined, processed, and packaged foods and moving toward an unrefined, unprocessed plant–based diet that is centered on fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables, intact whole grains and legumes.”</em>

In regard to physical activity, the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CDC</a> recommends:

<em>“2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) of <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/glossary/index.html#mod-intensity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">moderate-intensity aerobic activity</a> (i.e., brisk walking) every week and <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/glossary/index.html#muscle-strength\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">muscle-strengthening activities</a> on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).”</em>

<strong>Preparing for the Road Ahead</strong>

It would be easy to follow the above guidelines in an ideal scenario, but the real world is less accommodating, so before you get started there is one thing that you need to know: becoming and remaining healthy is like becoming and remaining wealthy, it’s all about consistency. If you want to stay healthy then you must commit to it absolutely.

1449,1,"2016-03-29 19:15:34","2016-03-29 19:15:34","Many Americans understand the impact that stress has on their lives. According to the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2011/final-2011.pdf\">American Psychological Association</a>, over 60 percent of Americans believe that their stress has a ‘moderate,’ ‘strong’ or ‘very strong’ impact on their physical and mental health. While this awareness is important, further steps must be taken in order for an individual to manage his or her stress level – steps that most Americans are not taking.

There are steps that individuals can take steps to manage the impact of stress. The first step is for an individual to realize that he or she in control of his or her own life, including thoughts, emotions, schedules, environment, and reactions to problems that arise. Next, individuals must identify the sources of their stress (their stressors). Stress management interventions may involve the avoidance or changing of these stressors when possible; the altering of reactions if avoidance or change is not possible; and the devotion of time and energy to take proper care of oneself (including time for proper rest and relaxation). Of course, there is no single method of managing stress that will work for everyone. Sometimes a combination of stress reduction techniques will prove most effective. Along with the interventions listed above, such techniques include:
<ul>
 	<li>Exercise</li>
 	<li>Proper nutrition</li>
 	<li>Practice of relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation</li>
 	<li>Reduction of caffeine and sugar intake</li>
 	<li>Prioritization of events (learning how to say “no” to certain events)</li>
 	<li>Cessation of bad habits such as excessive alcohol consumption, smoking and illicit drug use</li>
 	<li>Change of focus from negative thoughts to positive thoughts</li>
 	<li>Maintenance of supportive relationships and avoidance of unsupportive or unhealthy ones</li>
 	<li>Acceptance that it is okay to ask for help when needed</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
Individuals who are concerned about their stress level or a possible anxiety disorder should consult a healthcare professional who can make the appropriate diagnosis and discuss treatment options.

<h3>Understanding Alcohol and the Standard Drink</h3>
Alcohol is also known as ethanol, and is a neurotoxic, psychedelic chemical compound that is formed by the fermentation of sugars and yeasts. It is absorbed in both the stomach and small intestine where it is metabolized by liver enzymes. When alcohol is broken down and absorbed by the body its properties produce an intoxicating effect on the individual with the effect becoming more pronounced the higher one’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level.

The <a href=\"http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Practitioner/pocketguide/pocket_guide2.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)</a> states that, “A standard drink is any drink that contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol (about 0.6 fluid ounces or 1.2 tablespoons).” This translates to 12 oz of a beverage containing 5 percent alcohol, 5 oz of a beverage containing 12 percent alcohol, and 1.5 oz  of a beverage containing 40 percent alcohol all constituting one “standard drink.” And according to the <a href=\"http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/DietaryGuidelines2010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dietary Guidelines for Americans</a>, moderate drinking is up to one standard drink per day for women and up to two standard drinks per day for men. While this may seem easy enough to abide by, the problem occurs when a standard drink serving (of 12 oz for example) doesn’t come with <em>standard</em> alcohol content for the serving size.

The Health Services at Brown University state that:

<em>“Understanding the rate of metabolism is critical to understanding the effects of alcohol. In general, the liver can process one ounce of liquor (or one standard drink) in one hour. If you consume more than this, your system becomes saturated, and the additional alcohol will accumulate in the blood and body tissues until it can be metabolized.”</em>

And as <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/07/craft-beers-get-heavy-on-the-alcohol.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CNBC</a> remarks, craft beers “whose sales grew 22 percent to $19.6 billion in 2014 and continued a four-year streak of double digit growth, is driving a sea change in American palates with heavier doses of alcohol.”

What this means is that Americans crave the type of beer that comes with higher alcohol content, yet the serving sizes of these craft beers are typically 12 oz. So if you drink a 12 oz beer with an alcohol by volume (ABV) of 10 percent, then you’ve just had two standard drinks in one sitting and there is roughly 14 grams of pure alcohol floating in your system waiting to be metabolized.
<h3>Drinking Levels Revisited</h3>
The <a href=\"http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/moderate-binge-drinking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NIAAA</a> states that, “binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels to 0.08 g/dL. This typically occurs after 4 drinks for women and 5 drinks for men—in about two hours.” And that heavy drinking is, “drinking 5 or more drinks on the same occasion on each of 5 or more days in the past 30 days.”

As you may have noticed these higher levels of drinking are defined by BAC and not how many beer bottles you’ve accumulated. For example, if you had two bottles of a 12 oz craft beer with a 10 percent ABV you might consider your drinking habits to be in moderation, but with the higher alcohol content, these two beers would cause your BAC to go up to 0.055g/dL as opposed to 0.027g/dL as it would with two “standard” drinks.

The increased demand for craft beers with high ABVs, the drinking culture established in college, and the marketing efforts used in media to normalize drinking all weave together to create a hazardous environment where the need to drink (media), meets past behavior (college), and mixes with current trends (high ABVs) to beg the question, what is moderate?<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"> </span>
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
Moderate drinking isn’t impossible and even has some marginal health benefits. However, there are numerous factors that need to be weighed heavily when deciding to drink, such as: how have I historically approached drinks, how do I view media that promotes alcohol (favorably?), and what type of alcohol do I gravitate towards? The answer to these questions will enable you to determine whether you are likely to drink in moderation; but still, such as the case with rising ABVs, the term “drink responsibly” is also subject to change.

Genes are so influential to animals, plants, and microorganisms (which all pass along their genes to their offspring) that the manipulation of them has become an area of great study, and great concern because the consequences of passing on engineered genes have unknown consequences so far.
<h3>Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)</h3>
According to the <a href=\"http://www.nongmoproject.org/learn-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Non-GMO Project</a>, GMOs “are living organisms whose genetic material has been artificially manipulated in a laboratory through genetic engineering, or GE.” And while this source is admittedly biased, there is basis for concern as they go on to state in their FAQ that:

<em>“Most developed nations do not consider GMOs to be safe. In more than 60 countries around the world, including Australia, Japan, and all of the countries in the European Union, there are significant restrictions or outright bans on the production and sale of GMOs. In the U.S., the government has approved GMOs based on studies conducted by the same corporations that created them and profit from their sale. Increasingly, Americans are taking matters into their own hands and choosing to opt out of the GMO experiment.”</em>

So why do GMOs persist if they are considered unsafe by many? The answer is that being able to create organisms that have desired traits, such as crops that resist herbicides and animals that grow larger and faster, is profitable, practical, and can lead to scientific breakthroughs, such as cures for presently incurable diseases. But these benefits come into conflict by purported issues that arise from genetic engineering, such as more pesticides used on crops and leading to people being more prone to allergies and cancer. However, there are no conclusive studies that correlate GMOs to these negative claims.
<h3>Human Genetic Modification</h3>
While GMOs are the beginning, the natural end result of being able to manipulate the genes of organisms is to be able to do it with people. With that said, there has been a notable rejection of this potential use of genetic engineering from the <a href=\"http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=9006\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Center for Genetics and Society (CGS)</a>. With an upcoming International Summit on Human Gene Editing, the CGS released an open letter detailing why they have chosen to take this stance. Of particular note are the themes of inequality and the lack of control that will pervade such a scenario once people have control of what genes get passed on.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
According to <a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/gmos-pros-and-cons#1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Healthline</a>, “GMO seeds are used to plant 90 percent of corn, soybeans, and cotton grown in the U.S.” This means that Americans are almost guaranteed to have consumed and will continue to consume GMO products. There are proponents on both sides of the GMO debate, and while there are no conclusive studies connecting GMOs to many of the negative claims that come from those that oppose them, the fact remains that many prominent countries have made it clear that they want nothing to do with GMOs. On top of that, when it comes to genetic modification in humans, even scientists are extremely hazardous of the consequences, both known and unknown.

According to the <a href=\"http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/DietaryGuidelines2010.pdf\"><i>Guidelines</i></a>, whole foods that naturally contain sugars also naturally contain vitamins, minerals, fiber, water, and other essential nutrients — all of which contribute to \"diluting\" the concentration of sugar in the food.

These foods and beverages include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, dairy products, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds that are prepared without added sugars, starches, solid fats, and sodium. These foods are high in nutrients (nutrient–dense) and low in calories. Foods and beverages that contain excessive amounts of added sugar, on the other hand, are not as nutritionally beneficial.

Where there is added sugar, there are more calories but not more nutritional value. Items with added sugars are thus energy–dense and nutrient–poor — the overall calorie density of the food increases while the overall nutrient density decreases.
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
Recommendations for added sugars in the diet vary between different organizations, and there is no consensus regarding what constitutes acceptable levels. However, one common theme seems to run through all of the recommendations, and that is that individuals should decrease their consumption of added sugars.

The <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2014/consultation-sugar-guideline/en/\">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> recommends that added sugar should account for less than 10 percent of total calories per day, and is considering adding the suggestion that less than 5 percent per day would provide additional benefits.

The <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyDietGoals/Added-Sugars_UCM_305858_Article.jsp\">American Heart Association (AHA)</a> recommends a prudent upper limit — for most American women, that is no more than 100 calories per day (about 6 teaspoons of sugar) and for most American men, no more than 150 calories per day (about 9 teaspoons).

When foods and beverages with added sugar are routinely consumed in place of nutritious plant–based foods such as fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables, intact whole grains and legumes, as well as lean proteins, it becomes increasingly difficult for individuals to achieve recommended nutrient intake while controlling calories. In the interest of your optimal health, it is important to understand the amounts of added sugars present in the food products you consume, and to monitor the intake of these products.","Naturally Occurring Sugars Versus Added Sugars","Distinguishing between naturally occurring sugars and added sugars.","publish","open","open","","naturally_occurring_sugars_versus_added_sugars","","","2017-07-20 20:56:44","2017-07-20 20:56:44","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/naturally_occurring_sugars_versus_added_sugars/",0,"post","",0

Unfortunately, interrupted sleep is a fact of life for parents of a newborn which makes those first few months of parenthood utterly and completely exhausting.  It is not at all unusual for new parents to feel sleep deprived and wonder if they will ever get a good night’s sleep again.

While a night of uninterrupted sleep is unlikely those first few months, there are strategies you can use to maximize the amount of rest you do get. Incorporating those strategies can help to alleviate some of the negative health consequences that can occur due to disrupted sleep.

<!--more-->

<strong>Effects of Disrupted Sleep</strong>

This probably comes as no surprise, especially if you are currently in the midst of caring for a newborn…but adequate sleep is a vital component of your health and well–being, and when you don’t sleep well, many important aspects of your life can suffer including your mood, cognitive ability, attention span and energy level.

Numerous studies support this conclusion including a <a href=\"http://www.journalsleep.org/ViewAbstract.aspx?pid=30292\">study</a> published in the November 2015 journal <em>Sleep</em> that examined the effects of three different sleep conditions—three consecutive nights of either forced awakenings, delayed bedtimes or uninterrupted sleep--on 62 healthy men and women. Results confirmed the negative consequences interrupted sleep has on your energy level and mood. The study found that after the first night the participants who were subjected to eight forced awakenings and those with delayed bedtimes showed similar low positive mood and high negative mood. After two nights however, the group with forced awakenings had a 31 percent reduction in their positive mood and the group with a delayed bedtime had only a 12 percent reduction in positive mood compared to the first day. Both groups had similar negative moods on all three days. The researchers discovered that the forced awakening group had shorter periods of deep, slow-wave restorative sleep than the group with the delayed bedtime, and the lack of this type of sleep had a statistically significant association with the participant’s reduction in positive mood. They also found that interrupted sleep not only reduced participant’s energy levels, but also reduced their feelings of sympathy and friendliness. Another <a href=\"http://www.sleep-journal.com/article/S1389-9457(14)00157-9/abstract\">study</a> conducted on students and published in the July 2014 issue of <em>Sleep Medicine</em>, found a causal link between interrupted sleep patterns and reduced cognitive abilities, shortened attention spans, and negative moods.

<strong>What Can You Do?</strong>

Of course, the joys of new parenthood can go a long way towards making up for the sleep deprivation you feel, but you can also employ some strategies to help mitigate the effects of interrupted sleep. Most parenting experts suggest trying the following:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Sleep when your baby sleeps.</strong> This can’t be emphasized enough! When your baby naps, you nap. When your baby goes to bed at night, it’s time for you to go to bed too. Turn off your phone, computer, and tablet. Leave the dishes in the sink, the laundry in the hamper and any other household chores that aren’t finished for another time. Your sleep is much more important.</li>
 	<li><strong>Split nighttime duties with your partner.</strong> This can be done in several different ways depending on your specific situation. If your baby is bottle fed, divide the night into four hour shifts, so each of you can get four hours of uninterrupted sleep, or alternate entire nights so each of you get a full night of uninterrupted sleep every other night. Another option is simply alternating who feeds and changes the baby each time the baby awakens. (You can even sleep in separate rooms during this time so the parent that is “off-duty” can get undisturbed sleep.) If the baby is breast fed, nursing mothers could pump a bottle of breast milk in advance so her partner can take a turn feeding the baby at night. If pumping breast milk is not an option, the partner can bring the baby to the breastfeeding mom and handle nighttime diaper changes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keep your room quiet, dark, and unstimulating.</strong> For overnight feedings and diaper changes, keep lighting as low as possible using a night light with low illumination, and keep distractions to a minimum.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ask for and accept help:</strong> If any trust worthy adult in your life asks if you need any help, say yes! Have them spend time with the baby while you take a nap. Or, if your family members or friends want to visit say yes and ask them to let you take a nap to recharge.</li>
 	<li><strong>Remember there is a light at the end of the tunnel:</strong> Although you may feel like you’ll never get a good night’s sleep again, remember that this too shall pass. Babies generally start sleeping for longer, more humane stretches of time by 3 to 6 months of age.</li>
</ul>
Being a new parent has many highs and lows—it is a joyful time and an exhausting time as well. While sleep deprivation is almost guaranteed in the first few months of your baby’s life, it is also possible to get some relief. Try some--or better yet all--of the strategies above to maximize the amount of rest you do get. Remember that a fundamental aspect of being a good parent is taking good care of yourself so you can take good care of your family!","New Parents And Sleep","New Parents And Sleep","publish","open","open","","new-parents-and-sleep","","","2017-07-20 16:10:09","2017-07-20 16:10:09","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/new-parents-and-sleep/",0,"post","",0

A <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/17/health/senate-grills-dr-oz/\">Congressional Subcommittee is investigating Dr. Oz for false claims</a> about the health benefits of “Pure Green Coffee,” marketed as a miracle weight loss cure despite a lack of scientific evidence. While Dr. Oz is the most high-profile celebrity to be caught in the controversy surrounding dietary supplements, he is not alone in facing scrutiny.

In 2013, a <a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789248\">research study in the </a><a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789248\">Annals of Internal Medicine</a> suggested that multivitamins are not useful in maintaining health, while USA TODAY recently reported on the unregulated <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/19/dietary-supplements-executives-criminal-records-spiked/4114451/\">dietary supplements industry</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/16/amphetamine-like-compound-sports-supplements-craze-detonate/4041043/\">undisclosed ingredients</a> found in some multivitamins.
<h3>Eat Healthy Foods Not Hype</h3>
\"It is important not to get carried away by broad headlines that do not take every individual situation into account and only offer so much information,\" says Dr. Susan Spear, EHE Vice President of Medical Affairs. \"Every individual case is unique, based on a person's medical history, background, lifestyle, diet and other factors. Before determining whether to include or eliminate multivitamins from your nutritional routine, consult with a doctor who knows you and is familiar with your medical history.\"

The need for medical consultation with a healthcare professional cannot be overstated. By taking supplements based on advertisements and hearsay, you will (at best) be wasting money, but will also (at worst) run the risk of damaging your health. If your doctor does recommend the use of a supplement, be sure to research the brand and ingredients carefully before purchase.
<h3>What Your Body Needs</h3>
While the headlines may now be focused on a celebrity doctor’s questionable promotion of supplements, an important health truth should not be overlooked. The use of supplements can never substitute for proper food choices and healthy eating. According to the <a href=\"http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/\">Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC)</a>, you should be obtaining your nutrients from real foods that contain many other substances that promote health. The key is to eat a wide variety of foods including fruits, vegetables (especially green leafy vegetables), whole grains, fresh beans and lean sources of protein that can adequately nourish your body with all necessary vitamins and provide many other important nutritional elements such as fiber, antioxidants and phytochemicals in their proper forms.
<h3>What Most Diets Contain</h3>
Most Americans are not eating the right foods and are therefore not obtaining the necessary vitamins. For example, over 90 percent of the grains consumed in America are refined (bran and germ are removed), and refined grains constitute 21 percent of the average American's caloric intake. The typical caloric intake of most Americans includes:
<ul>
 	<li>Two-thirds from highly refined and processed foods which have been stripped off their nutrients.</li>
 	<li>17 percent from caloric sweeteners</li>
 	<li>23 percent from refined/processed oils that are added to foods</li>
</ul>
This dietary pattern is calorie-rich and nutrient-poor. By consuming a diet that is much more nutrient-rich, the vast majority of individuals can eliminate the nutrient deficiencies associated with a diet that is nutrient-poor. This common sense approach will always outweigh the medical quackery, fad diets, and miracle cure-alls that come and go.

Understanding the complexities of medical care and navigating an intimidating healthcare system add to the frustration and the feeling of helplessness. Nurses continue to be our best ally, as both caregiver and resource.

The contribution of nurses is frequently unrecognized over the physician in medicine. Nurses play a critical role, particularly in preventive care. Assessing a patient’s condition requires more than diagnosing ailments; it frequently requires a thoughtful and honest conversation with a patient.

“Nurses have been the 'face of healthcare' to the patient,” a recent <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertszczerba/2014/09/23/looking-to-transform-healthcare-ask-a-nurse/\">Forbes</a> article explains, because they put us as ease. This is more than just a sentiment. <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/jobs/news/2013/05/02/nursing-the-most-trusted-profession-america/fWz2EONyNzO3yC0c0BoBKN/story.html\">Studies have consistently demonstrated</a> that nursing is the most trusted profession in America. Many of us find nurses more approachable than doctors and feel less intimated to ask questions.

Corporate <a href=\"http://eheintl.com/me\">preventive care programs</a> with strong nursing staffs are at the vanguard of employee health. In these programs, nurses serve as educators in promoting healthy living and disease prevention in addition to their clinical duties.
<div>

“From Minute Clinics to the hospital setting, nurses remain patient centered and are true advocates for the well being of individuals,” explains Marianne Dyke, an EHE nurse practitioner.

“That’s why EHE International employs many nurses and nurse practitioners in its offices nationwide.”

</div>
The role of nurses in delivering care and advocating for patients is expanding within the evolving heathcare system. In <a href=\"http://www.ruckelshauscenter.wsu.edu/projects/documents/NurseStaffingfinal.pdf\">hospital setting research</a>, nurses have been shown to decrease a length of stay for patients and subsequently decrease associated costs.  In order to live a healthy life and stay out of the hospital altogether, nurses provide consistent reinforcement and compassionate care. As doctors in the U.S. turn to specialization over general practice, nurses are filling a gap in medical centers and (increasingly) in <img src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nurse_guy.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"nurse_guy\" align=\"right\" />preventive programs for employee health.

Yet shortages remain. EHE nurse Mia Ross says that nurses are not readily accepted into the preventive/wellness realm.
<div>“But I think we can fill the void.  We are astute listeners, critical thinkers and are not afraid to advocate for patients and their wellbeing.  Imagine, though, if we had more nurses dedicated to prevention, subsequently bypassing hospitalization completely.  How much time and money would be saved?”</div>
Businesses have learned that employee health and wellbeing cannot be taken for granted. It’s unproductive to have sick staff and fiscally unsound to pay for chronic, preventable diseases. Detecting medical problems early and supporting healthy lifestyles is an ethical decision and smart business strategy. Nurses are vital to the success of preventive care and thus provide the foundation for employee health.

1456,1,"2015-06-23 19:15:46","2015-06-23 19:15:46","Foods that are refined, processed, and/or packaged – whether organic or non-organic – often contain high levels of added sodium/salt, saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, added sugars/caloric sweeteners, added fats/oils, refined flours/grains, and/or hydrogenated/Trans fats. As your diet is critical in maintaining your health, knowing how to read the Nutrition Facts Label and the Ingredients List on food items is necessary in understanding exactly what you’re putting into your body. This article will examine these two items and can help you to make better food decisions.
<h3><strong>What is the Nutrition Facts Label?</strong></h3>
Commonly found on the back of packaged food items, the Nutrition Facts Label displays pertinent nutritional information about a particular food product (See Figure 1). In 1990, the <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-104/pdf/STATUTE-104-Pg2353.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nutrition Labeling and Education Act</a> made it mandatory that this label appear on food items regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This label contains key information that empowers individuals to make informed health choices including: the serving size and servings per container, the amount of calories consumed per serving, the amount of nutrients consumed per serving, and the recommended values of certain nutrients based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

[caption id=\"attachment_1659\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"237\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1659\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nutritionlabel.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth165ampnamenutritionlabel.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: The Nutrition Facts Label as it appears on food. Image sourced from Wikipedia.\" width=\"237\" height=\"454\" /> Figure 1: The Nutrition Facts Label as it appears on food. Image sourced from Wikipedia.[/caption]

The “Serving Size” and “Servings per Container” values at the top of the label can be used to guide understanding of the other values on the label. For example, if one serving size portion contains 230 calories and 160mg of sodium, then two serving size portions will contain 460 calories and 320mg of sodium. The serving size, per the FDA, is standardized across similar foods and is shown in units such as cups or teaspoons followed by their metric equivalents in grams.

The amounts of “Calories” per serving along with the amount of “Calories from Fat” are displayed beneath the servings per container. Both weight gain and loss are commonly associated with caloric intake, making this section of particular importance to many individuals. However, calories are simply energy, and solely managing one’s caloric intake doesn’t lead to lasting health as such an approach does not factor in nutrients. There is a reason that the term “empty calories” exists.

Beneath the calories is the “Nutrients” section which lists the values of important nutrients including fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, protein, and vitamins. For practical purposes, this section can be split up into two sub-sections: the nutrients that you want to limit and the nutrients that you want to maximize. In essence, foods containing vitamins (examples of which include vitamins A through K, iron, calcium, zinc, and so on) should be consumed in abundance, whereas foods with very little vitamins and/or large amounts of nutrients that are not vitamins (i.e. fat, cholesterol, etc.) should be limited.

Lastly, there is the section that includes nutrient intake recommendations based on a 2,000-calorie diet. As you may have noticed in Figure 1, the nutrients present on this list contain those that should be limited.
<h3><strong>Reading the List of Ingredients</strong></h3>
[caption id=\"attachment_1660\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"461\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1660\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ingredientslist.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth315ampnameingredientslist.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2: The List of Ingredients highlighted in red. Image sourced from the Boston Public Health Commission.\" width=\"461\" height=\"308\" /> Figure 2: The List of Ingredients highlighted in red. Image sourced from the Boston Public Health Commission.[/caption]

While the Nutrition Facts Label goes a long way in making healthy food choices, it is only half of the picture. It is also important to know the ingredients that were used in making the food. The Ingredients List is normally found near the Nutrition Facts Label for convenience (See Figure 2).

According to the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyEating/Understanding-Ingredients-on-Food-Labels_UCM_433234_Article.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Heart Association</a>, there are two things to consider when reading the Ingredients List:

<strong>The “ingredients are listed in order of quantity.”</strong> This means that the first few ingredients listed will be the ones that are primarily incorporated into the food. For example, in Figure 2 above, water, black beans, tomatoes, tomato paste, corn, and red bell pepper are the primary ingredients of the food product (in descending order), with the rest of the ingredients making up less than two percent of the food.

While the ingredients list displayed in Figure 2 is easy to read and understand, many other products aren’t so…digestible (See Figure 3 below).

2. The “ingredients can go by several names.” As you will notice in Figure 3, the marshmallows have the second largest presence in the food and include several types of added sugar (among other additives). This brings us to the fact that certain ingredients, in this case sugar, can go by different names (i.e. “sugar,” “corn syrup,” and “dextrose”). In fact, many seemingly common ingredients can go by a variety of names. To fully understand what you are consuming, consult materials from the

<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
In order to maintain your health, you must watch what you eat; however, simply choosing organic, sugar-free, or reduced calorie products won’t do the trick. You must know and understand the Nutrition Facts Label as well as the Ingredients List in order to ensure that what you’re putting into your body is: a) healthy and b) suitable for your current dietary needs. When selecting a product from the grocery store, it is recommended that you turn the container over and read the back.

But while reducing or eliminating refined, processed, and/or packaged foods is fundamental advice for cleaning up your diet, sometimes things get lost in translation when it comes time to shop.

According to the <a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/natural-resources-environment/organic-agriculture/organic-market-overview.aspx\">United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)</a>, the demand for organic produce has exploded from 2005 to 2014 and the trend looks to continue. However, it is important to note that simply eating organic food doesn’t necessarily mean that one’s diet is safer and more nutritious.
<h3><strong>What does “USDA Organic” Mean?</strong></h3>
According to the <a href=\"http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateC&amp;navID=NationalOrganicProgram&amp;leftNav=NationalOrganicProgram&amp;page=NOPConsumers&amp;description=Consumers&amp;acct=nopgeninfo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USDA</a> itself:

<em>“Organic is a labeling term that indicates that the food or other agricultural product has been produced through approved methods. These methods integrate cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. Synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, irradiation, and genetic engineering may not be used.”</em>

In addition to the above, the <a href=\"http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/NOPOrganicLabeling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Organic Program</a> of the USDA observes 4 organic distinctions:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>100 Percent Organic:</strong> In this category, all ingredients and processing aids must be organic, the information panel must identify organic ingredients, and the product may display the USDA organic seal.</li>
 	<li><strong>Organic:</strong> In this category, most of the ingredients are organic, but non-organic ingredients specified on a National List may be used as well (up to five percent of food content). Foods that are organic must identify organic ingredients and may display the USDA organic seal.</li>
 	<li><strong>“Made with organic:</strong>” This category specifies multi-ingredient products that contain at least 70 percent organic ingredients. The information panel must identify these ingredients, and the product may display up to three organic ingredients or ingredient categories on the front; the USDA organic seal may not be used.</li>
 	<li><strong>Specific organic ingredients:</strong> This category specifies multi-ingredient products with less than 70 percent of its ingredients being organic. These products may only list its organic ingredients on the back as such and may not display the USDA organic seal.</li>
</ul>
It should be noted that none of the aforementioned categories require the inclusion of labels for livestock products such as:<em> free-range, cage-free, natural, grass-fed, pasture-raised, humane, and no added hormones.</em>
<h3><strong>How Does Organic Food Compare to Non-Organic Food?</strong></h3>
Individuals who aren’t familiar with the definition(s) of organic food tend to think that they are paying a premium for food that is safer and more nutritious than non-organic food; however, this is only partially true. According to a study published in the <a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1355685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Annals of Internal Medicine</a>, the nutritional content of organic foods was not determined to be significantly more nutritious than non-organic food; but the study goes on to say that the consumption of “organic foods may reduce exposure to pesticide residues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.”

Since the nutritional comparison of organic foods to non-organic foods is mostly a moot point, individuals who are looking to understand why choosing organic foods could be beneficial should look to what forms of pesticides are used on the food. According to the <a href=\"http://npic.orst.edu/health/ovc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Pesticide Information Center (NPIC)</a>, organic foods have less pesticide residue when compared to their conventionally-grown counter-parts (non-organic food). Additionally, organic products may not use synthetic pesticides.

While “organic pesticides vs. synthetic pesticides” is an ongoing debate in need of further research, with some sources remarking upon the harmlessness of both (<a href=\"http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/03/20/myth-busting-are-synthetic-pesticides-used-with-some-gmos-more-dangerous-than-natural-ones/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://farmguide.org/article_organic_vs_chemical.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2</a>), what has been decided is that organic foods contain less pesticide residue.
<h3><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h3>
Choosing organic foods over non-organic foods won’t have a drastic effect on your health. Organic foods aren’t significantly more nutritious than non-organic foods and may still be refined, processed, and/or packaged—meaning their nutritional content may be reduced.

Even with organic foods, the things to look out for remain the same: added sodium/salt, saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, added sugars/caloric sweeteners, added fats/oils, refined flours/grains, and hydrogenated/Trans fats. Individuals are encouraged to take note of these ingredients and their respective amounts as indicated on the Nutrition Label.

By making decisions based on nutritional content rather than focusing too heavily on organic vs. non-organic, you can ensure that your diet is healthy and nutritious.

<!--<br-->While people usually subscribe to the notion that physical fitness is for athletes and models, this article will present physical fitness as a preventive healthcare measure for everyone.
<h3>What is “Health-Related Physical Fitness?”</h3>
Getting active and ‘in-shape’ as a means to maintain one’s good health is termed “health-related physical fitness,” and the American College of Sports Medicine’s <em>Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription</em> defines it as:
<ul>
 	<li><em>“A state characterized by (a) an ability to perform daily activities with vigor, and (b) a demonstration of traits and capacities that are associated with low risk of premature development of hypokinetic diseases (i.e., those associated with physical inactivity.”</em> (pg. 57)</li>
</ul>
The “traits and capacities” mentioned are the components that determine health-related physical fitness. These include body composition, cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength and endurance, and flexibility.
<h3><strong>The Components of Health-Related Physical Fitness</strong></h3>
To better understand the importance of increasing your physical fitness, you must first understand the physical fitness components listed above.

<strong>Body composition:</strong> One’s body is naturally designed in a certain way. Some people are tall and others short, some people are bulky and others svelte. For this reason, body composition — the ratio of bodyweight made up of fat to that made up of fat-free tissue — is the preferred way to distinguish whether one is in a good place in regard to weight. Having a high ratio of fat to non-fat is detrimental to your health.

<strong>Cardiorespiratory endurance:</strong> This component is the one that most individuals associate with physical fitness as it involves many muscles in the body, is typically moderate-to-high intensity, and includes dynamic movements — all while being performed for extended periods of time. The standard method of determining cardiorespiratory endurance is measuring one’s maximal oxygen uptake (or rate of oxygen consumption) during exercise (typically cardiovascular exercise).

The <em>Guidelines for Exercise and Testing Prescription</em> states that:
<ul>
 	<li>“… (a) low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness have been associated with markedly increased risk of premature death from all causes and specifically from cardiovascular disease, (b) increases in cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with a reduction in death from all causes, and (c) high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with higher levels of habitual physical activity, which are, in turn, associated with many health benefits.” (pg. 68)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Muscular strength and endurance: </strong>When it comes to the muscles in your body, strength and endurance are the categories that will determine your physical fitness. ‘Muscular strength’ involves the amount of force that a muscle can generate in a given time, and ‘muscular endurance’ refers to the number of times a muscle can be used (contracted) without exhausting.
As with cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength and endurance has numerous health benefits including: increasing your metabolism, reducing the ratio of fat to fat-free tissue in the body, and increasing bone mass.

<strong>Flexibility:</strong> One of the more overlooked components of physical fitness, flexibility determines your range of motion. Being able to move without unnecessary encumbrance is key to physical fitness as it will determine your fitness ceiling. Inflexible people are unable to recruit their joints and muscles efficiently, and are thus limited in the exercises that they can perform. Put another way, inflexibility in a situation that might require greater range of motion (such as exercise) can cause tissue damage as the joints and muscles are pushed pass their limits.
<h3><strong>Tips and Exercises to Increase Health-Related Physical Fitness</strong></h3>
Now that we understand the importance of being physically fit along with the components of fitness, it is time to act on this knowledge. But first, here are some important guidelines to remember from EHE International Health Coach Gayle Salomon:
<ul>
 	<li>Focus o<img class=\"alignright wp-image-1667\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Exercise1.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth325ampnameExercise1.jpg\" alt=\"sport goods and a sports shoe\" width=\"336\" height=\"336\" />n you; don’t make comparisons with others unless it is used for motivation.</li>
 	<li>Physical fitness is about movement and activity. Try an exercise and see if you can do it; worry about performance later.</li>
 	<li>When just starting, remember to take it slow—progression is the aim.</li>
 	<li>Once you’ve become comfortable doing certain exercises/running certain distances, look to gradually increase the workload.</li>
 	<li>Age is a big factor in progression: the older you are, the more time it will take and the more care you should give to your fitness regimen.</li>
 	<li>When you start getting comfortable, you can switch up your routine by adding or targeting different muscle groups; just try something totally new so that you can keep improving.</li>
 	<li>Observe what you are doing so that progression may take place. Monitor your heart rate, count your steps, and time your runs. Take your exercise routine seriously by tracking your progress.</li>
</ul>
By adhering to these simple guidelines, you will have a safe and healthy mentality when looking to increase your physical fitness.
<h3><strong>Exercises</strong></h3>
<strong>Body composition: </strong>Becoming physically fit will naturally help your body composition, so there aren’t specific exercises for body composition.

<strong>Cardiorespiratory endurance: </strong>Some effective exercises are: walking, jogging, running, sprinting, interval training, bicycling, and swimming. Remember to start out slow; look to increase your workload as you feel more comfortable.

<strong>Muscular strength and endurance</strong>: Effective exercises include push-ups, sit-ups, squats, lunges, and calf-raises. For muscular strength, you should look to perform these movements with added weight; for muscular endurance, you should look to practice timed tests in which you perform as many repetitions as you can, without sacrificing form. Beginners should first get used to the movements and then look to improve. More advanced individuals should look to increase resistance for strength and increase time, repetitions, or both for endurance.

<strong>Flexibility training: </strong>These exercises should be performed every day, ideally twice a day — 5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes before going to bed. Flexibility training is similar to muscular training in that it is specific to target location (i.e., if you stretch your legs, your shoulders won’t necessarily increase in flexibility). Some effective exercises are: hamstring and quadriceps stretching (standing, sitting, or lying down), spinal twists, knees-to-chest, back extensions, forward and side lunges, shoulder stretches, and neck stretches. Beginners and advanced individuals should go as far as they can until they feel slightly uncomfortable — but not to the point of pain — and look to stretch, lunge, etc. a little further each time.
<h3><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h3>
Becoming physically fit is a mindset as much as it is a performance. By understanding the benefits of being physically fit and the types of exercise that will help you achieve your goals, you can embark on a journey toward a healthier life.

There are 13 essential vitamins: vitamins A, C, D, E and K along with the eight B vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folate). Each vitamin plays an important role in body function and all vitamins are necessary for good health.

The best way for an individual to ensure that he or she is consuming adequate amounts of vitamins is to adhere to a healthy diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense, plant-based foods.

According to the <a href=\"http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/pdfs/scientific-report-of-the-2015-dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC)</a>, nutrient intake should come primarily from food because foods contain many other substances that promote health. The use of supplements can never substitute for proper food choices.

A diet that includes a wide variety of foods including fruits, vegetables (especially green leafy vegetables), whole grains, fresh beans and lean sources of protein can adequately nourish an individual’s body with all necessary vitamins in addition to many other known important nutritional elements such as fiber, antioxidants and phytochemicals in their proper forms.

The key is to make sure that the majority of one’s calories come from a variety of foods within each of these food groups.

There are a few times when supplements may be necessary to meet specific nutrient requirements. For example, individuals who have little exposure to sunlight or are otherwise at risk for vitamin D deficiency may need a vitamin D supplement. Women of childbearing age who do not consume an adequate diet may benefit from a folic acid supplement to help reduce the risk of certain birth defects. Adults over 50 may benefit from a B12 supplement as their ability to properly absorb and metabolize B12 may be reduced. Those who choose to follow a vegan diet may also benefit from a B12 supplement.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
If you have concerns about possible vitamin deficiencies, it is important that you discuss them with a physician. It is unnecessary and possibly even dangerous to make supplement decisions on your own. By adhering to a diet with the elements listed above, you should achieve nutrient adequacy without the need for supplements while also benefiting from the many other nutritional elements found in these healthful foods.

A person’s pain threshold varies, not to mention it is impossible to measure pain outside of an individual asking the person suffering of the intensity of the sensation on a scale of 1 to 10—so prescribing pain medicine is a tricky situation. Nevertheless, the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> states that: “The United States is in the midst of a prescription painkiller overdose epidemic.” And while the amount of prescribed painkillers has quadrupled since 1999, there “has not been an overall change in the amount of pain that Americans report.”
<h3>The Physicians are Prescribing, which means…?</h3>
<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1677\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/painkiller_vert_20151215.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth200ampnamepainkiller_vert_20151215.jpg\" alt=\"painkiller_vert\" width=\"353\" height=\"485\" />According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_156209.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MedlinePlus</a> article, primary care doctors are the leading prescribers of narcotic painkillers with 28.1 million prescriptions being issued in 2013, data which was gathered by looking at “Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage claims.” Additionally, nurse practitioners and physician assistants issued 7.2 million prescriptions in their own right.

With these figures in mind, it comes as no surprise that the CDC reports that: “Every day, 44 people in the U.S. die from overdose of prescription painkillers, and many more become addicted.”

So what is being done? What can be done? The article concludes by saying education in better prescription practices, increased oversight on healthcare providers, greater community awareness, and a willingness from both sides to curb habit-forming treatment as being the keys to success in the endeavor to reduce the painkiller epidemic.

Another key component in reducing the amount of lives affected by prescription painkillers is to focus on preventive healthcare. While accidents happen and pain from different sources can be inevitable, treating the problem shouldn’t make it more severe. Preventive healthcare, which conditions patients to keep an eye on their health, while also giving them the support they need in order to accomplish their health goals will enable them to manage their situation better than just relying on prescribed medicine to magically fix the situation.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
Being prescribed painkillers doesn’t mitigate the risk inherent in these drugs. It simply allows individuals the ability to consume them in a (hopefully) controlled environment. But the fact of the matter is that people are overdosing or becoming addicted to these drugs at an increased rate that coincides with the amount of prescriptions being issues, all without reducing pain. So what does that mean? It means that magic beans can grow into a giant beanstalk leading to a golden solution to pain, but you must first evade the giant looking to keep you trapped in his castle.

“While 18.6 million people remain underemployed,” explains labor journalist <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/labor/americans-are-working-so-hard-its-actually-killing-people?page=0%2C0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">

In the face of increased professional demands, economic insecurity, and pressure to perform, it is no wonder the workplace is a major source of stress for many of us. This stress not only affects individuals, it negatively impacts businesses and the economy as a whole. A <a href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/stressed-work-youre-alone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new report</a> by the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania examines the situation:

“Stressed workers are less engaged, exhibit higher absenteeism and are generally less productive, according to a recent Towers Watson survey of 22,347 employees in 12 countries, including the U.S. More than half of the respondents cited inadequate staffing as the major cause of stress.”

As a result, employees are demanding employers create healthier workplaces. Improving the environment in which we work – and spend a significant portion of our time – is a remedy for stress that businesses should heed.

“When employees don’t feel valued,” writes Deborah Mckeever and Dee Edington in <a href=\"http://www.shrm.org/hrdisciplines/benefits/articles/pages/wellness-shared-values.aspx#sthash.UipjvnTW.dpuf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SHRM article</a>, “they tend to become more stressed and less in control, resulting in emotional exhaustion and an increased desire to leave the company.”

Some companies have instituted <a href=\"../../../../com/eheintl/www/wellness.html\">wellness programs</a> to help improve workplace health and safety for their employees. This solution is both humane and makes good business sense.

“From a health care perspective, stress is bad for business and bad for the economy,” says Stewart Friedman of <a href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/stressed-work-youre-alone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wharton</a>. “And it’s bad for our social bonds. When people feel resentment and strain, the physical and psychological problems are disabling. The most obvious problem for most businesses is retention — <a href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/when-its-time-to-quit-your-job/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">people quit</a>. It’s definitely happening.”
<h2>Relief Denied</h2>
<img src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stress_labor.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"stress_labor\" align=\"right\" />The place people frequently turn to for help in managing stress – the company healthcare provider – is often not equipped with the resources to aid over-taxed employees. The American Psychological Association’s <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2012/report-summary.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stressed in America</a> study exposes sobering statistics from workers who engage the health care system to deal with stress:
<ul>
 	<li>Thirty-two percent of Americans say it is very/extremely important to talk with their providers about managing stress, yet only 17 percent report that these conversations are happening often/always.</li>
 	<li>Overall, 53 percent of Americans say they receive little to no support from their health care provider in managing their stress.</li>
 	<li>Thirty-five percent of adults say their stress has increased in the past year and 33 percent say that they never discuss ways to manage stress with their health care provider.</li>
 	<li>People who do not receive stress or behavioral management support from their health care provider are more likely to say their stress increased in the past year than those who do get support (38 percent with little/no support vs. 29 percent with a lot/great deal of support).</li>
</ul>
The APA data shines a light on the desperate need for job-specific healthcare prevention and intervention to alleviate personal tension. Workplace pressures are increasingly recognized as a key staff satisfaction issue, and smart businesses are developing corporate benefit programs to address employee well being. Casual Fridays or inspirational posters in the lunch room are inadequate responses to the rising levels of stress in the American workforce. We need real business solutions, including preventive medical care.
<h2>Stress Management</h2>
We may not be able to control all of the external forces bearing down on us at work, but we can take steps to manage how we react to it.

“Small changes can yield big results when it comes to managing workplace stress,” recommends EHE Health Coach Ana Escudero. “The key is letting go of things that are beyond your control, like other people’s behavior, and focusing instead on the things you can control, such as your own thoughts and actions.”

As everyone experiences stress differently, the way we handle it will also be largely individual. There are proven stress management tips everyone can master to prevent a pressure-inducing situation or to lessen its impact. Consider combining several of these behaviors to overcome unhealthy tension at work:
<ul>
 	<li>Avoid controllable stressors: Reduce the amount of time spent with people or situations that consistently cause stress.</li>
 	<li>Prioritize: Create a \"to-do\" list on a regular basis and eliminate unimportant tasks and responsibilities to prevent a sense of overwhelming demands.</li>
 	<li>Exercise: Regular exercise is one of the most effective ways to prevent and manage stress because it helps to relieve mental and physical tension (as little as 20 minutes a day makes a big difference). EHE Health Coaches suggest “walking around the office, taking the stairs, stretching, and making time for regular breaks for small bursts of physical activity.”</li>
 	<li>Set aside time to relax: Every day should include “down time” to improve concentration, productivity and overall well being.</li>
 	<li>Consume a nutritious diet: A nutrient-dense diet based on whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits can help to boost the immune system, increase energy levels, and improve your mood.</li>
 	<li>Cut back on caffeine: Excessive consumption of coffee, energy drinks, and soda can lead to anxiety, irritability, sleeplessness, and headaches.</li>
 	<li>Give up bad habits: Alcohol and cigarettes can increase stress levels. Any type of self-medicating provides only temporary relief and ultimately increases stress.</li>
 	<li>Get plenty of rest: Uninterrupted sleep for at least seven to eight hours is essential to the health of the mind and body.</li>
 	<li>Focus on the positive: When stress levels are high, a moment should be taken to reflect on all of the positive things in life. A good laugh is an effective coping mechanism.</li>
 	<li>Maintain supportive relationships: Individuals with strong social support systems experience fewer physical and emotional symptoms of stress than those without these relationships. A strong support system can provide a buffer from the negative effects of stress.</li>
 	<li>Ask for help: If pressure becomes unbearable, seek assistance from your supervisor or HR manager and consult with a physician for medical guidance.</li>
</ul>
<img src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stress_overworked.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"stress_overworked\" align=\"right\" />Unfortunately, stress is a part of work life and cannot be entirely prevented. As employers begin to take employee wellness seriously, future studies and surveys will hopefully reveal a less-stressed workforce.

In the meantime, we can make small changes in our behaviors to more effectively manage our everyday pain points and be proactive in requesting a healthy workplace.
EHE Physician Dr. Frederica Linick recommends taking a moment each day to gain perspective so that work does not end up sabotaging your health:

“Stress is not good for you. It is bad for your immune system, cardiovascular system, and mental health. Just because others in your company tolerate stress doesn’t mean it’s right for you or that you are inadequate.”

1464,1,"2014-09-08 19:15:59","2014-09-08 19:15:59","A comprehensive study on America’s growing obesity epidemic has little good news. The research report, <a href=\"http://stateofobesity.org/\">State of Obesity</a>, reveals that over 1/3 of Americans are becoming dangerously fatter in every category. The report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and Trust for America’s Health (TFAH) breaks down obesity rates by geography. The population of every state in the union is now over 20% obese, while 20 states top 30%.

<a href=\"http://www.stateofobesity.org\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/obesityrates.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"obesityrates\" /></a>

\"This is a problem that doesn't have either a single solution or a single cause,\" said Jeffrey Levi, Ph.D., executive director of TFAH, reported in the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/04/state-obesity-obese-weight_n_5766478.html\">Huffington Post</a>. \"But certainly, over the last 30 years, we've seen a dramatic increase in fast food outlets and our lifestyle changes ... in terms of what we're eating, the quality of what we're eating and where we're eating it, and [decreasing] physical activity levels.\"

As Dr. Levi suggests, medical professionals are only beginning to understand the extent of the problem and must grapple with a condition which stretches beyond health issues. How we eat is a complex story.
<h2>Inequality of Obesity</h2>
News reports have picked up on the obesity report’s illustration of <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/04/us-health-obesity-idUSKBN0GZ1D420140904\">the disparities across population groups.</a> Being extremely overweight in America is directly related to where you live, your racial/ethnic background, and income level.

&nbsp;

<a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/09/04/study-americans-24-pounds-fatter-than-in-1960?int=98e708\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1687\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/racialrates.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth450ampnameracialrates.jpg\" alt=\"racial rates\" width=\"670\" height=\"237\" />
Reporter Lindsey Cook</a> pinpoints a few notable statistics which makes obesity a higher risk for certain groups:
“8 percent of blacks live in a <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_ct.html\">census tract</a> with a supermarket, compared with 31 percent of whites. A whopping 23.5 million of Americans don't live within a mile of a supermarket. This is important because research has shown blacks with a supermarket in their neighborhood consume 32 percent more fruits and vegetables.”

With whole communities unable to access grocery stores for nutritious foods, people rely on fat-filled convenience store snacks for their primary meals.
<h2>Systemic Malnutrition</h2>
Kelly D. Brownell and Katherine Battle Horgen, authors of Food Fight: The Inside Story of the Food Industry, puts the blame squarely on a \"toxic food environment” created in modern America. June Stevens sums the basic claims of <a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/1/239.2.full\">Food Fight</a>:
<div></div>
<div>“Simply stated, increased food consumption means increased profits—but increased food consumption is not consistent with the health needs of our over-nourished population. The authors expose the role of corporations that sell foods that contribute to the obesity epidemic, but they stop short of painting the food companies as nefarious villains.”</div>
Essentially, industrial food production and distribution makes it difficult for many of us to eat healthy, regardless of our food choices.
<h2>Baked in the Genes</h2>
<a href=\"http://consumer.healthday.com/kids-health-information-23/child-development-news-124/appetite-genes-might-be-key-to-childhood-obesity-684963.html\">Recent British studies</a> have found some infants are born with greater appetites and, thus, a predisposition towards weight gain.

\"Appetite is key and it would be sensible for parents to keep an eye on children who appear to be responding to food a lot more avidly than their peers,\" said Clare Llewellyn a researcher at the University College London. \"Those who have inherited genes that make them feel less full are more likely to overeat and gain weight.\"

If you don’t have the natural mental and physical triggers to stop eating, you may easily develop eating behaviors that lead to chronic obesity.
<h2>Expanding Waistlines &amp; Wallets</h2>
Obesity takes an enormous toll on one’s personal health and longevity, medical professionals warn. The <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2012/08/16/what-the-obesity-epidemic-costs-us-infographic\">financial costs </a>of a heavier and unhealthy American public should not be overlooked:
<ul>
 	<li>$160 Billion increase in medical expenses</li>
 	<li>$938 Billion increase in fuel costs from passenger weight</li>
 	<li>$7.5 Billion increase in clothing expenses for bigger sizes</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
Obesity has complicated healthcare, environmental, genetic and socio-economic factors. Preventive health measures to address obesity can only go so far given the surrounding thicket of social issues and policy decisions. Reducing excessive weight gain is no longer a simple dinner plate choice.

However, this doesn’t mean you should give up on diet and exercise or fall into despair if you are struggling with obesity. You can take a first step by visiting a doctor with expertise in preventive care. By fully assessing your medical condition, a physician will develop a solid nutrition and exercise plan to fit your lifestyle and your goals.

He is a father of five children, devoted husband, suburban homeowner, and busy professional. On the weekends, he tries to find time for exercise but more often runs around on errands for his kids. This ordinary guy had an epiphany of sorts a year ago, which lead him this week to the Himalayan mountains to take part in a 100-mile endurance race.

His first thought before starting the grueling training regiment for a high-altitude marathon was, “Am I fit enough to do this?” His second thought was to visit a <a href=\"http://eheintl.com/overview\">preventive care doctor.</a>

Watch a recap of how David prepared for the race:

<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDPrlM3mzWQ\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>

David’s journey – from assessing his life goals, to training every day, to getting his pre-departure immunization shots – has been in partnership with an EHE International preventive care clinic. He talked with EHE doctors to get a “lay of the land” of his health and ensure that he was healthy enough to run the race. Every step of the way, David followed up with EHE doctors and clinicians to test his vitals and prepare his body and mind for the challenges he’s now facing.

<img class=\"\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 5px 15px; float: right;\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Blog_fouse_run.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"Blog_fouse_run\" width=\"309\" height=\"231\" align=\"right\" />The week-long race through oxygen-deprived mountaintops could be considered a punishing way enter middle age. Most of us would not even attempt it. David has a different perspective. As he writes on <a href=\"http://dfouseindia.com/2014/10/16/the-road-to-darjeeling/\">his blog</a> from his first day in Darjeeling, India:

“A race like this is not for everyone, but I do hope it encourages others will find their own India. Already this has been an incredible experience. The tough part is still ahead, but I’m looking forward to the challenge.”

Addressing his fundamental health is only half the battle; the other half is mental. By taking the time to evaluate his personal priorities early on and establish a fitness baseline from the start, David can fully concentrate on his performance and daily benchmarks.

David arrived safe and sound, and on Twitter he reports feeling energized for the start of the 100-mile race.

<img src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fouse_tweet.pngt1488480168246\" alt=\"fouse_tweet\" />

With David’s commitment to preventive care, we believe he will far exceed even his own high expectations.

Serious infections may lead to cancer if not caught early and treated. Council Speaker <a href=\"http://council.nyc.gov/d8/html/members/home.shtml\">Melissa Mark-Viverito</a> announced the surprising diagnosis on her Twitter account:

<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tweetspeaker.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"tweetspeaker\" />

Like many of us who live busy lives, the Speaker overlooked her own personal health and skipped regular check-ups with a doctor. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/prevention.htm\">Medical experts recommend</a> women receive PAP tests every 3 years beginning at age 21, and be screened for HPV at age 30. Because signs are not always visible, most women who have <a href=\"http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/human-papillomavirus.html#f\">HPV infections never know it</a>. Visit a gynecologist at least once a year for check-ups regardless of your sexual activity or age, and follow your doctor’s recommendations regarding frequency of HPV screenings.

All men and women should be evaluated for HPV vaccination eligibility during preventive health exams or with a primary care physician. Results from <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/HPV/index.html\">studies demonstrate</a> that the HPV vaccine is effective in reducing infections; however, as EHE physician Dr. Seema Sarin notes:

“The HPV vaccine is not perfectly protective, meaning that some men and women will acquire an HPV infection despite having being vaccinated. The vaccine does not prevent other sexually-transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Thus, it is important to always practice safer sex to reduce the risk of all sexually-transmitted diseases.”

Speaker Mark-Viverito, who is 45, plans to use her personal medical struggle to raise awareness about HPV:

<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tweet_viverito.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"tweet_viverito\" />
Some people feel uncomfortable discussing sexually-transmitted diseases and, therefore, do not request medical screenings.

\"Presumably the stigma of sexually transmitted diseases occurs to discourage unsafe sexual behavior,” says psychologist <a href=\"http://michaelfriedmanphd.com/\">Dr. Mike Friedman</a>. “But for many it actually discourages testing and responsible preventive behavior. We need to find a way to encourage safe sex without discouraging testing.\"

Melissa Mark-Viverito’s openness about her HPV screening and treatment has already inspired at least one person to be pro-active with her health. Responding to the Speaker’s announcement, a follower was reminded of the importance of regular preventive exams:

“I haven't seen a GYN in like 5 years. You just inspired me,” <a href=\"http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140818/east-harlem/council-speaker-melissa-mark-viverito-reveals-on-twitter-she-has-hpv\">she tweeted</a>. “We need to take care of ourselves so we can take care of others.\"

Morgan Chase, recently announced in a memo to his corporate board—and subsequently to the public-at-large—that he was diagnosed with throat cancer. As the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/j-p-morgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-diagnosed-with-throat-cancer-1404254638\" target=\"blank\">Wall Street Journal reported</a>, the memo stated that “the cancer was caught quickly and confined to one area.” It was discovered as part of an executive physical exam – a perk that Mr. Dimon’s company provides to its leadership.

<img class=\"alignright\" title=\"executive health women\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/executive_health_women.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"executive health women\" width=\"263\" height=\"281\" align=\"left\" />In an article in <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-07-03/the-c-suites-savvy-cancer-fighting-strategy\" target=\"blank\">Business Week</a>, Kyle Stock wrote that “CEO cancer is different from the cancer the rest of us get” because of the “blue-chip” preventive medical care. However, so-called ‘c-suite preventive health benefits’ are not part of an exclusive medical practice nor reserved for CEOs. Preventive exams are for everyone, and more and more businesses are providing a physical exam that is just as comprehensive as an executive physical exam to all employees as part of general corporate health benefits.

<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>As Stock <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-07-03/the-c-suites-savvy-cancer-fighting-strategy\" target=\"blank\">acknowledges in his article</a>, cancer that is caught early through preventive exams is “probably smaller—and less widespread—thanks to some of the most vigilant preventive health care in the world.” Qualified preventive health doctors and clinicians provide this “vigilant” care to all individuals, executive or not. Title is left at the door of the doctor’s office. By highlighting differences in health benefits for CEOs, Stock suggests all employees should benefit from preventive care. We couldn’t <a href=\"http://eheintl.com/me\">agree more</a>.

Every person should receive an annual preventive examination. Mr. Dimon’s case is not unique. A preventive exam with a trained physician is designed to detect the early signs of cancer, heart disease and other chronic illnesses, and to empower patients with resources to protect their future health. With some disorders, early intervention can treat the problem before it becomes life-threatening. In other circumstances, patients may completely avoid developing major medical problems by making lifestyle changes through proper nutrition, exercise, and behavior modification. Both prevention and detection are critical and integral parts of preventive healthcare for all people.

Mr. Dimon’s executive status does not make his body more or less vulnerable to disease. Every person requires preventive exams to proactively manage long-term health.

A medical journal article condemned the cost and questioned the validity of preventive healthcare, while a handful of consumer groups have shined a spotlight on low-cost screenings marketed to the public. The headlines related to these topics suggest that all preventive exams are either shams or unnecessary.

Looking beyond the screaming banners, however, medical professionals support the need for annual preventive exams. It’s the inferior application by unscrupulous clinics which is under fire—as it should be.

Dr. Michael Rothenberg kickstarted a media frenzy in an article in <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1877214\">JAMA titled “The $50,000 Physical”</a> by calling attention to superfluous diagnoses that are taxing the healthcare system. Dr. Rothberg later clarified his perspective in a <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/6/16/5807608/maybe-we-dont-all-need-annual-physicals\">VOX interview</a>, noting that preventive exams with a doctor are important:
<div>

“What I was trying to get at in this article had to do with the dangers of looking for problems when patients don't have any complaints. I definitely didn't want people to come away thinking you should never examine a patient or that patients shouldn't go to the doctor.”

<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/19/group-criticizes-health-fairs/10773791/\">Public Citizen</a> raised an alarm about an emerging trend of hospitals marketing generic mass screenings. The exams, they contend, are money generators for the hospitals and are not focused on patient care. Rudimentary diagnoses may scare patients and lead to expensive and unnecessary hospital and specialist visits when people take unwarranted action on incomplete information.

What the headlines missed is that these generic screenings do not follow established best practices in preventive medicine. This is the real controversy.

<img src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Preventive_Health_Experts.jpgt1488480168246\" alt=\"Preventive_Health_Experts\" align=\"right\" />When performed correctly, preventive exams encompass more than a simple test or blood draw, and do not lead to unnecessary follow-up visits with specialists and/or hospitals. As EHE has been practicing <a href=\"../../../../com/eheintl/www/history-mission.html\">for over 100 years</a>, preventive care encompasses a comprehensive set of examinations and consultations with physicians and clinical experts to develop a clear understanding of a person’s current health and to determine modifications that can protect future good health.

It must be made clear that the articles mentioned above are condemning poor-quality medical screenings — often designed to increase revenue for the clinic — and not preventive exams in general. The scientific benefits of preventive medicine are clear but perhaps muddled in the media buzz. A more accurate headline for Dr. Rothberg and Public Citizen would read:

It is important to remember that there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke and there is no safe tobacco product. All forms of tobacco — cigarettes, pipes, cigars, hookahs, and smokeless tobacco — are hazardous to your health.

Additionally, although marketed as such, filtered or low-tar products are not any ‘healthier’ for you than regular cigarettes.

If you are a smoker who wants to quit, there is an abundance of help available. Nicotine replacement products and non-nicotine medications approved by the FDA can be very effective in helping you cope with cravings and withdrawal, while counseling and behavioral therapy can help you address the psychological aspects of quitting smoking.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
Remember that there is there is no one ‘right’ way to quit and that no single approach will be successful for all individuals. It may take several attempts, but quitting smoking is possible and the health benefits are undeniable and life-saving.

<ul>
 	<li>The <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Cholesterol/PreventionTreatmentofHighCholesterol/Know-Your-Fats_UCM_305628_Article.jsp\"> American Heart Association’s (AHA) </a> Nutrition Committee recommends that healthy Americans over the age of two:
<ul>
 	<li>Consume 25 to 35 percent of their total daily calories from fats in foods such as fish, nuts, and vegetable oils.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Limit the amount of saturated fats consumed to less than seven percent of total daily calories. For example, individuals that need approximately 2,000 calories per day should consume less than 140 calories (or 16 grams) from saturated fats.</li>
 	<li>Limit the amount of trans fats consumed per day to less than one percent of total daily calories. For example, individuals that need approximately 2,000 calories per day should consume less than 20 calories (or 2 grams) from trans fats.</li>
 	<li>Consume fats that are mainly monounsaturated or polyunsaturated.</li>
 	<li>The <a href=\"http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10490\">Institute of Medicine</a> (IOM) recommends that the total fat intake for adults 19 years of age and older be limited to no more that 20 to 35 percent of total calories. The IOM does not indicate maximum levels for saturated fat or trans fat, but suggests that individuals consume as little of these fats as possible.</li>
 	<li>The <a href=\"http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/DietaryGuidelines2010.pdf\">Guidelines</a> recommend that Americans consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat by replacing them with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. To reduce cardiovascular disease risk further, the Guidelines suggest lowering the percentage to seven percent. Additionally, the consumption of trans fats should be should be kept as low as possible.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Nutrition Facts Label</strong>

It is important for individuals to monitor their fat intake. The Nutrition Facts label found on foods and beverages is there to help individuals compare foods and make informed food choices. The Nutrition Facts label must display the total fat per serving as well as the amount of saturated fat and trans fat per serving. Different brands of the same food type can vary widely in their fat content.

When choosing between products, the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm079609.htm\">FDA</a> recommends looking at the Nutrition Facts label and combining the saturated and trans fats and choosing the product with the lower combined total. Health experts recommend that the consumption of fats be kept as low as possible, but recognize that eliminating them completely from the diet is not practical.

An important caveat to be aware of is that manufacturers are able to list trans fats that fall below .5 grams per serving as “0 grams of trans fat per serving.” Consumers can view the products ingredient list, however, to see if a product does indeed contain some trans fats. If the terms, “shortening,\" \"partially-hydrogenated vegetable oil,\" or \"hydrogenated vegetable oil\" appear on the ingredient list, then the product does contain trans fats.

The consistent consumption of excessive fat, particularly the wrong types of fat, can lead to serious health complications. Individuals must educate themselves regarding the many foods and beverages—both expected and unexpected—that contains saturated and trans fats so that they may monitor their intake and not exceed recommendations. The key is to choose unsaturated fats and to stay within individual calorie needs.","Recommendations For Fat Intake","Understanding the recommended values for fat intake.","publish","open","open","","recommendations_for_fat_intake","","","2017-07-20 16:22:45","2017-07-20 16:22:45","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/recommendations_for_fat_intake/",0,"post","",0

According to the <a href=\"http://acsm.org/about-acsm/media-room/news-releases/2011/08/01/acsm-issues-new-recommendations-on-quantity-and-quality-of-exercise\">ACSM</a>, a variety of exercises should be performed that work all muscle groups and can be performed up to three days per week (though there should be at least 48 hours between sessions). Most adults should perform two to four exercise ‘sets’ (a set is a specific number of exercise repetitions) per muscle group. Individuals should rest for two to three minutes between sets.

<span id=\"hs_cos_wrapper_post_body\" data-hs-cos-type=\"rich_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\">The resistance or weight selected for each exercise should allow an individual to complete 8 to 12 repetitions per set, or the number needed to cause muscle fatigue but not exhaustion. This will improve strength and power for most adults. Older adults and/or those new to strength training may want to start with lower resistance and higher amounts of repetitions.</span>

According to the <a href=\"http://www.acsm.org/docs/brochures/resistance-training.pdf\">ACSM</a>, it is important to have specific goals to work toward (e.g., increasing muscle size, and/or improving muscle strength, power, and/or endurance). Each of these goals can be enhanced by modifying the load (or weight) lifted in a given set, the volume (or total number of exercises, repetitions and sets) performed in a given session, the rest period between sets, and the frequency or number of exercise sessions per week. The load, volume, rest periods, and frequency with which an individual performs strength training exercises should always be determined by his or her goals, fitness level, age, health, skills, interest, and convenience.","Recommendations For Strength Training","What are the recommendations on strength training?","publish","open","open","","recommendations_for_strength_training","","","2017-07-20 20:50:14","2017-07-20 20:50:14","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/recommendations_for_strength_training/",0,"post","",0

People are understandably distraught over a popular figure dying by his own hand.

Robin was a performer bursting with vitality; sadness to the point of suicide didn’t appear to be in his DNA.

Although he has opened up about his <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/1317105/robin-williams-career-haunted-by-addiction\">alcohol and drug addiction</a> over the years, Robin’s manic performance style left audiences with an impression his life was perhaps over-flowing at times but not depressed.

Robin Williams’s death is a reminder of our misperceptions about clinical depression and its severity.

Depression is the most prominent mental disorder and a major national health risk, affecting nearly <a href=\"http://www.nimh.nih.gov/statistics/1MDD_ADULT.shtml\">16 million Americans</a> at some point in their lives. “But despite how common the illness is,” reports Karen Rowan of <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/robin-williams-death-difference-between-depression-normal-sadness-012550678.html\">Yahoo News</a>, “many people do not understand exactly what it means to have depression, and often think of it as being the same as sadness.” Mental health professionals define <a href=\"http://www.nami.org/template.cfm?section=Depression\">clinical depression</a> as a severe mental state that doesn’t go away with time and places the sufferer’s physical health in danger.

Mental illness takes a toll on the body. “Depression is a prevalent and chronic mental disorder causing suffering, loss of function and loss of life,” says psychologist Dr. Mike Friedman, medical advisory board member at EHE International. Dr. Friedman further explains on his <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brick-brick/201402/why-happier-doesn-t-necessarily-mean-healthier\">Psychology Today blog</a>:
<div>

“Depression is associated with reduced heart rate variability, platelet aggregation and increased sympathetic nervous system activity, all of which increase risks for patients with cardiac disease. Further, depressed individuals often have reduced energy and lower motivation, which interferes with activities like exercise, buying and preparing healthy foods, and attending medical appointments, all of which are critical for restoring heart health.”

Robin’s death tragically demonstrates the greatest threat. “Suicide is a common symptom of severe, clinical depression,” explains Dr. John M. Grohol on <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2014/08/11/robin-williams-bipolar-sufferer-dead-at-63-due-to-suicide/\">his blog</a>. “When properly treated, the feelings of suicide often remit as the depression lifts. But even under treatment, sometimes people choose to take their own life.”

Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., but Robin’s fate is not the inevitable result of depression. Mental illness has warning signs, knowable health risk factors, and available treatment options. \"But there are barriers that need to be overcome to adequately address depression,\" notes Dr. Friedman in a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/13/opinion/friedman-robin-williams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CNN.com op-ed</a>. \"First and foremost, the stigma of depression is making us sicker.\" May the great funnyman’s loss serve to enlighten us about the reality of depression and help us to recognize and treat it early.

This is significant because added sugar is typically refined sugar and is therefore stripped of all nutrients, essentially making them empty calories. But we’ll get back to that.

After the 10 day period, the results were considerable: While weight was unaffected during this time, their metabolic health changed significantly.

If you were wondering, metabolic health is how well you break down and utilize the nutrients and minerals found in foods and beverages. “Good” foods such as fruits and vegetables are easier to break down and provide numerous macro and micronutrients—in other words they offer more bang for your buck and help maintain your metabolism. “Bad” foods, typically those that are highly processed and refined, do the opposite.

But this is somewhat common knowledge. The truly shocking facet of this study is how quickly metabolic health was affected once added sugar was removed. From the article:

<em>“On average, the subjects’ LDL cholesterol, the kind implicated in heart disease, fell by 10 points. Their diastolic blood pressure fell five points. Their triglycerides, a type of fat that travels in the blood and contributes to heart disease, dropped 33 points. And their fasting blood sugar and insulin levels – indicators of their diabetes risk – likewise markedly improved.”</em>

To further the point about how significant this is, the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centers of Disease Control and Prevention</a> remark that as of 2012, “about half of all adults—117 million people—had one or more chronic health conditions.” These conditions, also known as lifestyle diseases (think about that), include “heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and arthritis—are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems.”

So by know I think you know where I’m going with this: This study showed how quickly added sugar destroys the body and begins to set the foundation for chronic disease later on in life. Unhealthy individuals don’t just become unhealthy; they always were, since childhood.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health</h3>
Refined sugars are stripped of all macro and micronutrients making them “empty calories.” But the misconception is that “empty calories” simply cause weight gain, when in realty they cause weight gain through the deterioration of one’s metabolism—which of course leads to other problems besides having a gut. And on the topic of guts, alcohol (such as the seemingly innocuous beer) contains refined sugars, refined carbohydrates, and an addictive agent as a nice cherry on top.

So what did we learn? The mountain of evidence tells us to cut out added sugars (and on a related note alcohol) from our diet. But the marketing for these products will encourage consumption. As always the choice will be yours…

CVS’s bold announcement (relinquishing nearly $2 billion in sales) may not effect whether someone takes their first puff or their last.

Yet, when a national pharmacy and wellness retailer stops selling a product known to cause preventable diseases to its customers, there’s an implicit preventive health message.

The health hazards of smoking are well documented (EHE first raised the <a href=\"http://digitaleditions.walsworthprintgroup.com/publication/?i=156215\">alarm in 1939</a>), and the benefits of quitting – no matter your age or when you stop – are undeniable. After the first 24 hours of quitting, for instance, a smoker’s chance of a heart attack decreases. But this knowledge doesn’t make quitting any easier.

The best way to stop smoking is to never start or quit as early as possible. We all struggle with forecasting risks when we make decisions about our health. Many smokers will tell you this is critical.

Recently, Star Trek Actor <a href=\"http://celebrity.yahoo.com/blogs/celeb-news/leonard-nimoy-reveals-he-has-copd--warns-against-smoking-223318587.html\">Leonard Nimoy announced</a> that he is suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) brought on by smoking. Fans became concerned when photographs of him with an oxygen tank surfaced.

As Mr. Nimoy soberly demonstrates, prevention is a mind-set we need to get into early. Thinking preventively may help as us navigate the array of health decisions we face every day. Smoking, in particular, is a behavior that can profoundly impact your health later in life.

Grazing throughout the day? No eating after 7 p.m.? The truth is that such eating patterns can have an impact on weight and overall health, but this impact is limited and is closely related to other dietary factors.

According to EHE International’s Dietician Jeff Novick, in light of the toxic food environment in the U.S., the frequency and timing of an individual’s meals is not as important as the types of foods consumed. In fact, when an individual adheres to a nutrient-rich, lower-calorie-dense diet, eating patterns are not as important as there is little danger of over-eating. Conversely, if an individual is consuming processed foods that are calorie-dense and nutrient-poor, he or she is much more likely to gain weight regardless of eating pattern.

The <a href=\"http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2010/\"><i>2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</i></a> recommend that we avoid processed and refined foods, and to replace them with lower calorie, nutrient–dense foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes and fat–free dairy products. In addition to weight management, a healthy dietary pattern that focuses on these types of foods can prevent diseases related to nutrient deficiencies and may also reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers.
<h3>The Bottom Line—For Your Health!</h3>
At the end of the day, the healthiest eating pattern is the one that works best for you – provided that you are consuming a healthy diet and performing regular physical activity. If you are eating mostly fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans, you have very little risk of overeating, no matter how many times a day you eat. If you are eating processed, calorie-dense foods, however, you have a very high risk of overeating and excessive calorie intake, no matter how many times a day you eat.

So are emotions really a hindrance for decision-making, or are they the scapegoat for a person who is dealing with emotional issues?

<a href=\"http://www.helpguide.org/home-pages/emotional-health.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Helpguide.org</a> describes emotionally healthy people as being in control of their emotions and behavior and “able to handle life's inevitable challenges, build strong relationships, and lead productive, fulfilling lives. They bounce back when bad things happen and can manage stress without falling apart.”

Being in control of one’s emotions is distinct from not employing them at all. Indeed, a past article from <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/intense-emotions-and-strong-feelings/201012/it-or-not-emotions-will-drive-the-decisions-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Psychology Today</a> states outright that emotions drive decisions and that it is up to the individual to practice emotional intelligence, which is the skill of using life experience and self awareness to best manage one’s emotions when faced with a problem.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
As humans are emotional beings from birth, and knowing that emotions play a significant role in the outcome of a given situation, it makes sense then to discard the belief that you must separate emotions from decisions and instead take on the idea that intelligently applying those emotions will enable you to not only trust that decision, but also yourself.

Of course, snow does have its perks. It is enjoyable to look at, ski on top of, sled through, and roll into snowmen and snowwomen. What is much less enjoyable is the fact that snow needs to be removed – from roads, driveways, sidewalks, stairs, and walkways.

And, while snow removal is almost always a nuisance, it can also be very dangerous if performed incorrectly or without proper precaution.

Here are some preventive health tips to keep in mind the next time you head outside to grab your shovel or start your snow blower:

<strong>Overall Health</strong> – Snow removal injuries can range from aches and muscle pulls to fatal heart attacks. If you have a medical condition or do not exercise regularly, it is important to consult a physician before shoveling or snow blowing.   It may not be a bad idea to hire someone to complete the work.

<strong>Clothing </strong>– According to the <a href=\"http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/winter/duringstorm/outdoorsafety.asp\">CDC</a>, you should dress in several layers of loose-fitting wool, silk, or polypropylene clothing; wear a hat, mittens, and a scarf or mask that covers the face and mouth; and wear a tightly-woven, wind and water-resistant coat and water-resistant boots.  Additionally, go indoors if persistent shivering occurs. Shivering should not be ignored as it is an important first sign that the body is losing heat.

<strong>Sun Safety </strong>– According to the <a href=\"http://www.skincancer.org/healthy-lifestyle/outdoor-activities/essential-sun-safety-information-for-skiers-and-snowboarders\">Skin Cancer Foundation (SCF)</a>, “snow reflects up to 80 percent of the UV light from the sun, meaning that you are often hit by the same rays twice.” Apply a broad–spectrum, water–resistant sunscreen of at least SPF 30 to all exposed areas 30 minutes before going outdoors. Reapply every two hours or as needed. You can protect your eyes and vision by wearing goggles or sunglasses that block 99 to 100 percent of both UVA and UVB rays.

<strong>Snow Removal Technique</strong> –<a href=\"http://newsroom.aaos.org/media-resources/news/snow-shoveling-throw-out-injuries-this-winter-not-your-back.htm\">The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)</a> recommends the following precautions:
<ul>
 	<li><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1728\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Snow3.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth353ampnameSnow3.jpg\" alt=\"Snow\" width=\"409\" height=\"271\" />Warm up muscles (especially the back, arm and leg muscles) by stretching for at least ten minutes before beginning snow removal.</li>
 	<li>Use a shovel that is appropriate for your height and strength.</li>
 	<li>Hold the shovel close to the body and always try to push rather than lift the snow. If lifting the snow cannot be avoided, it is important to do it properly by squatting with feet apart and lifting with the legs while keeping the back straight.</li>
 	<li>Lift only small amounts of snow at one time. Snow should never be thrown over the shoulder or to the side as those motions require twisting of the back and can lead to injury.</li>
 	<li>Remove snow early and often during a snowstorm when the snow is light and powdery.</li>
 	<li>Read instructions and carefully follow precautions listed in the operations manual when using a snow blower.</li>
 	<li>Never stick hands in a snow blower. If snow becomes too impacted, stop the engine and wait at least five seconds before using a solid object to clear wet snow or debris from the chute.</li>
 	<li>Take frequent breaks and drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. For both men and women, the most common sign of a heart attack is chest pain, pressure, or discomfort. Anyone who experiences these or other symptoms of a heart attack should stop and seek emergency care immediately.</li>
</ul>
So, the next time you head outdoors to remove snow, do it safely - take some extra time and heed the recommendations listed above.

This is reflected in the findings by a study published in 2002 titled, “<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luis_De_la_Fuente/publication/11105102_Late_diagnosis_of_HIV_infection_in_the_era_of_highly_active_antiretroviral_therapy_consequences_for_AIDS_incidence/links/00b7d53353850dcae7000000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Late diagnosis of HIV infection in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy: consequences for AIDS incidence.</a>”

This study assessed the trends and repercussions in AIDS-positive individuals who discovered that they were HIV-positive within the month of their AIDS diagnosis or the preceding month (deemed late-testers by the study) and compared them with the remainder of the AIDS-positive individuals.

This study takes place during the timeframe of 1994 through 2000, with 1996 onwards being significant as it coincided with the spread of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

<strong>Some of the findings from the study showed that:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>“Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Kaposi’s sarcoma were more frequent among late testers, whereas pulmonary tuberculosis and recurrent pneumonia were more frequent among the remainder.”</li>
 	<li>“Of the 18 755 AIDS cases diagnosed in the period 1994–1996, 24.1% were late testers, whereas among the 7825 diagnosed in the period 1998–2000, this percentage increased to 35.3% (P &lt; 0.001).”</li>
 	<li>“The results show that more than one-third of AIDS cases diagnosed in Spain between 1998 and 2000 had been unaware of their HIV infection until the month of diagnosis or the one immediately preceding it.”</li>
</ul>
While HAART has made HIV extremely manageable—to the point where it can be considered a chronic disease like diabetes—early detection remains the most important factor when treating it. Even as AIDS cases as a whole have gone down due to HAART, this study showed that HIV-positive individuals who don’t get tested are at an increased risk for developing AIDS.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
While HAART has made the HIV extremely manageable, early detection of the disease is still critical for treatment.

These vitamins are...
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> According to the <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>, <i>vitamin A</i> plays an important role in immune system function, vision, reproduction and cellular communication. It is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps to form and maintain the health of skin, teeth, bones, soft tissue and mucus membranes. Vitamin A also supports cell growth and differentiation and plays a critical role in the normal formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs, kidneys and other organs.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vitamin C: </strong> <i>Vitamin C</i> (also known as “ascorbic acid”) is a water-soluble vitamin that is needed for the growth and repair of tissues in all parts of the body as well as the formation of <i>collagen</i>, an important protein used to create skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, ligaments and blood vessels. Vitamin C plays an important role in the healing of wounds, normal immune system function and the maintenance of bone and tooth health. Vitamin C also works as an antioxidant that protects cells from free-radical damage.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> <i>Vitamin D</i> is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps to maintain normal blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. It also helps to maintain bone health. It is naturally found in only a few foods but is produced naturally by the body as a result of sun exposure.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vitamin E:</strong> <i>Vitamin E</i> is a fat-soluble vitamin found in many foods, fats and oils. Vitamin E plays a role in the formation of red blood cells, helps to widen blood vessels and helps to prevent blood clots. It also acts as an antioxidant. Vitamin E exists in eight different forms; <i>alpha-tocopherol</i> is the most active form in humans.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> <i>Vitamin K</i> is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in bone health and is essential to the function of several proteins involved in blood clotting. Blood is not able to clot without vitamin K.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vitamin B6:</strong> <i>Vitamin B6</i> is a member of the water-soluble family of B-complex vitamins. It is required for protein and glucose metabolism and is needed to make <i>hemoglobin</i>, the component of red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. Vitamin B6 is also required for normal nervous system function and is essential for immune system function as it helps to maintain the health of the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vitamin B12:</strong> <i>Vitamin B12</i> is a water-soluble vitamin that has the largest and most complex chemical structure of any vitamin. Vitamin B12 is essential for proper red blood cell formation, neurological function and DNA synthesis. It exists in several forms; mthylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin are the active forms in the human body.</li>
 	<li><strong>Biotin:</strong> <i>Biotin</i> (sometimes called “Vitamin H” or “Vitamin B7”) is a water-soluble vitamin that is generally classified as a B-complex vitamin. Biotin is essential for the formation of fatty acids and glucose, and allows the body to metabolize carbohydrates, fats and amino acids. Biotin is also important for normal embryonic growth, making it a critical nutrient during pregnancy.</li>
 	<li><strong>Folate:</strong> <i>Folate</i> (also called “Vitamin B9” or “folic acid”) is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin. Folate is needed to create DNA and RNA, and helps to prevent changes to DNA that may lead to cancer. Folate is also essential for the metabolism of homocysteine. A healthy diet with adequate levels of folate may reduce a woman's risk of having a child with a brain or spinal cord defect. To reduce the risk of neural-tube defects in newborns, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration introduced mandatory folic acid fortification of enriched cereal grain products in 1998.</li>
 	<li><strong>Niacin:</strong> <i>Niacin</i> (also known as “nicotinic acid” or “vitamin B3”) is a member of the water-soluble family of B-complex vitamins. Niacin plays a role in the function of the digestive system, skin and nerves. It is also helps the body to convert food to energy.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pantothenic Acid:</strong> <i>Pantothenic acid</i> (also known as “vitamin B5”) is a member of the water-soluble family of B-complex vitamins. Pantothenic acid is needed for the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It also plays a role in the production of hormones and cholesterol, and influences normal growth and development.</li>
 	<li><strong>Riboflavin:</strong> <i>Riboflavin</i> (also called “vitamin B2”) is a member of the water-soluble family of B-complex vitamins. Riboflavin is needed to help break down carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It plays a role in body growth and red blood cell production. Riboflavin also helps the body to release energy from carbohydrates and change vitamin B6 and folate into forms that the body can use.</li>
 	<li><strong>Thiamine:</strong> <i>Thiamine </i> (also called “vitamin B1” and “aneurin”) is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin. It plays a crucial role in certain metabolic reactions and helps the body's cells to convert carbohydrates into energy. It is essential for the functioning of the heart, muscles and nervous system.</li>

For most people, heartburn is a relatively harmless discomfort that can be treated effectively with lifestyle changes and over–the–counter medication.
<h3>Triggers</h3>
Common causes or \"triggers\" of heartburn include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Pregnancy</strong>: During pregnancy, the hormone progesterone can cause the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax and allow stomach acid to back up into the esophagus, resulting in heartburn. Additionally, a pregnant woman’s enlarged uterus can crowd the abdomen and push stomach acids upward (this is especially common in the third trimester).</li>
 	<li><strong>Certain foods and beverages</strong>: There are certain foods and beverages that commonly trigger heartburn including tomato–based foods, citrus fruits and juices, chocolate, peppermint, fatty or fried foods, salt and salty foods, garlic, onions, spicy food, caffeinated beverages such as coffee and tea, carbonated beverages and alcohol.</li>
 	<li><strong>Large meals</strong>: When an individual eats a large meal, his or her stomach becomes stretched. This stretching causes the individual to feel \"stuffed\" and also puts pressure on the LES that may cause stomach acid to back up into the esophagus. Any large meal can cause heartburn, even meals that do not contain foods and beverages that are known to trigger symptoms.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pressure on the stomach</strong>: Heartburn can be triggered when an individual puts pressure on his or her stomach by lying down after a meal, wearing tight clothing, bending over frequently, exercising when full and/or being overweight or obese.</li>
 	<li><strong>Smoking</strong>: Smoking weakens the LES which can exacerbate heartburn.</li>
 	<li><strong>Certain medications</strong>: Some medications cause heartburn by relaxing the LES. Such medications include drugs that are used to treat asthma and/or allergies, high blood pressure and urinary tract infections, as well as muscle relaxants, pain killers and anti–depressants.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prevention</h3>
Once an individual’s triggers are known, the avoidance of heartburn is often a simple matter of lifestyle modifications:
<ul>
 	<li>Avoid \"trigger\" foods and beverages</li>
 	<li>Consume a healthy diet</li>
 	<li>Maintain a healthy weight</li>
 	<li>Eat smaller, more frequent meals</li>
 	<li>Elevate the head of the bed</li>
 	<li>Lie facing the left in bed</li>
 	<li>Avoid eating before bed</li>
 	<li>Stop smoking or never start</li>
</ul>
Most heartburn symptoms will dissipate with the modifications listed above. However, if your symptoms are persistent and become more severe and/or frequent, it is important that you consult a healthcare professional.","Understanding Heartburn","Understanding the triggers of heartburn and how to prevent them.","publish","open","open","","understanding_heartburn","","","2017-07-20 20:45:31","2017-07-20 20:45:31","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/understanding_heartburn/",0,"post","",0
1486,1,"2016-12-22 19:16:33","2016-12-22 19:16:33","Wearable technology (or “wearables”) have exploded onto the scene and have become the must have item for the holidays. Whether you’re rocking a Fitbit wristband or an Apple Watch, wearables have become a symbol of cool. But when used properly they can also symbolize good health.

The selling point for wearables is in the trackers, or put another way in gathering data on particular health metrics. These devices are commonly used to track things such as steps, calories burned, heart rate, and even sleep hours. And when users log-in to their wearables’ website they can view this data on their dashboard. It’s almost like opening up the menu in a video game and viewing your character’s stats, but instead of leveling up in the virtual world you do so in the real one. Pretty cool!

However, getting these stats don’t come cheap as this technology is essentially asking people to do what research has been telling them to do for years, which is to eat right and exercise. With that said, wearables have changed the conversation from a lecture to more of a challenge.

Wellness programs within organizations have been getting a big push in the last decade as “<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2862441/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lifestyle diseases</a>” have become an overwhelming burden being responsible for 7 out of every 10 deaths annually and accounting for 86 percent of healthcare costs, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. And since incentives seem to be the way to go for organizations to promote wellness, tracking health metrics through a popular gizmo is just the medium to achieve this goal.

<img class=\"alignright wp-image-1744\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/smart_watch_20151222.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth208ampnamesmart_watch_20151222.jpg\" alt=\"smart_watch\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" />But employees win out too as health challenges issued by the organization (e.g., to reach 10,000 daily for a month) allows employees to get creative to meet these goals and gives them the impetus to create their own challenges. Now when individuals go to work and see their co-workers rocking wearables a bond is formed as the shared experience of working towards a health goal creates a sense of unity and belonging. Wearables then become a source of pride, but only as far as the motivation to meet health goals is present.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
Wearables are uniquely placed in an area where health promotion is needed in an accessible format. However, novelty is short-lived where lasting change isn’t. In order for individuals and organizations to get the most out of wearables both must rise to the challenge of leveling up their health.

<h3>Optimism and Health</h3>
Numerous studies have shown that individuals who are optimistic tend to live longer and enjoy numerous health benefits including better overall health. Research highlights include:
<ul>
 	<li>In a study published online in Psychological Bulletin on April 17, 2012, researchers from the Harvard University School of Public Health reviewed data from more than 200 previous studies and found that a positive psychological outlook appears to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular events. Specifically, factors such as optimism, life satisfaction and happiness are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease regardless of an individual’s age, socioeconomic status, body weight and smoking history.</li>
 	<li>In a study published in the February 28, 2011 online Archives of Internal Medicine, researchers at Duke University Medical Center tracked the psychological and physical health of hospitalized heart disease patients over a 15-year period. Researchers found that individuals who were optimistic (as determined by survey responses) about their diagnosis, treatment and recovery were more likely to be alive after 15 years than individuals with lower expectations. The researchers noted that the level of optimism displayed by patients did not have to be extreme to have an effect.</li>
</ul>
Optimists also tend to be adept at managing stress. Research has shown that high levels of stress can exacerbate existing illnesses and contribute to the development of conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, depression and obesity. Effective stress management is associated with many health benefits.
<h3>What is the Bottom Line?</h3>
Many studies have been conducted that support the premise that optimism is associated with better health outcomes, and while it is not yet possible to say that good health necessarily predicts an optimistic outlook or if an optimistic outlook necessarily predicts good health, the results remain the same: when you do good you feel good and vice-versa.

1488,1,"2016-06-08 19:16:36","2016-06-08 19:16:36","Yoga is a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) mind–body practice that typically combines physical postures and breathing techniques with meditation or relaxation. There are many styles, intensities and forms of yoga ranging from slow and gentle to athletic and vigorous.

<strong>Ashtanga:</strong> Ashtanga yoga is a fast-paced, intense style of yoga characterized by a highly vigorous, nonstop sequence of poses. It is commonly called \"power yoga\" because it demands flexibility, stamina and strength. Ashtanga yoga is most appropriate for individuals who are already athletic and want to add flexibility, balance and concentration to their exercise routines.

<strong>Bikram:</strong> This intensely physical form of yoga is also known as \"hot yoga\" because it is performed in a heated 100–degree room in order to increase flexibility. The Bikram method involves a set sequence of 26 yoga poses and two breathing exercises that is performed twice within a single 90–minute class. Every Bikram class follows the same sequence of 26 poses.

<strong>Hatha:</strong> Hatha yoga is the most commonly practiced form of yoga in the United States. It emphasizes physical postures or exercises (“asanas”) with the goal of balancing the opposites in one's life. In the U.S., Hatha yoga encompasses many of the physical types of yoga and is usually associated with a slower-paced class that includes simple breathing and meditation exercises.

<strong>Iyengar:</strong> This type of yoga focuses on symmetry, proper alignment and precise movements. In yoga, the word \"alignment\" describes the precise way in which the body should be positioned during the performance of each pose in order for the individual to obtain the maximum benefits of the pose and avoid injury. Iyengar yoga usually emphasizes holding poses over a long period of time and encourages the use of props such as yoga blankets, blocks and straps in order to bring the body into alignment.

<strong>Jnana:</strong> In Hinduism, Jnana Yoga is the practice of knowledge. This form of yoga emphasizes deep contemplation as practitioners seek Jnana (or \"wisdom\") through meditation. The goal is to be ‘one’ with a higher power.

<strong>Kundalini:</strong> This is one of the more spiritual types of yoga. Although the Kundalini sequences can be physically intense, this form of yoga emphasizes breathing, meditation, mudras (symbolic gestures) and chanting. It is designed to release a form of energy (“Kundalini”) that is believed by practitioners to be stored at the base of the spine. This type of yoga appeals to those who are up for both mental and physical challenges.

<strong>Viniyoga:</strong> This type of yoga links breath and movement in flowing exercises that are adapted to each individual. The Viniyoga tradition acknowledges that each individual has unique needs and abilities and believes that yoga practice should, therefore, be adapted to fit the particular situation of each person. The long, deep stretches of this style of yoga are ideal for beginners and people who want to focus on flexibility, injury recovery, body awareness and relaxation.

<strong>Vinyasa:</strong> Vinyasa yoga can be very diverse. It is usually a more vigorous style of yoga based on the performance of a series of poses that are synchronized with the breath. However, the pace can vary and there is no one particular sequence that instructors must follow (each instructor will likely teach in a different manner).

These are only a few of the more than 100 different forms of yoga practiced in the United States today.

1489,1,"2016-05-17 19:16:39","2016-05-17 19:16:39","Depressive disorders are very complex and occur for a variety of reasons. While depression can strike anyone regardless of age, background, socioeconomic status, or gender, depression rates for women are twice as high as those for men. Experts believe that depression occurs as a result of a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors.

<strong>Genetic Factors:</strong> Some types of depression tend to run in families. First–degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of individuals with major depressive disorder are two to three times more likely to develop the condition than individuals without a family history.

<strong>Biological Factors:</strong> There are several biological factors that are believed to contribute to depression: neurotransmitter imbalance, hormonal changes such as those related to thyroid problems, menopause, and other conditions, and physical changes to the brain.

<strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Traumatic events such as the death of a loved one, financial problems, a difficult relationship, or other high-stress situations can lead to depression. Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty as well as the development of medical conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and HIV can cause stress and make daily life difficult and, in turn, lead to depression among those trying to cope.

<strong>Psychological Factors:</strong> An individual’s vulnerability to depression can also depend on his or her psychological make–up. Specifically, individuals who have low self–esteem, who consistently view themselves and the world with pessimism and/or who are easily overwhelmed by stress appear to be more vulnerable to depression.
<h3>What is the Bottom Line?</h3>
If you suspect that you or a family member may be suffering from depression, it is imperative to seek care from a licensed mental health professional as soon as possible.

1490,1,"2016-08-02 19:16:40","2016-08-02 19:16:40","Distracted driving\" is the act of driving an automobile while also performing an activity that could divert the driver’s attention away from his or her primary task: driving.

<strong>Common distractions while driving include:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Texting</li>
 	<li>Using a cell phone or smart phone</li>
 	<li>Eating and drinking</li>
 	<li>Talking to passengers</li>
 	<li>Grooming</li>
 	<li>Applying cosmetics</li>
 	<li>Reading (including maps)</li>
 	<li>Using a navigation system</li>
 	<li>Watching a video</li>
 	<li>Adjusting a radio, CD player or MP3 player</li>
</ul>
According to Distraction.gov, a website created by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there are three types of distractions:
<ul>
 	<li><i>Visual</i>: An individual takes his or her eyes off the road</li>
 	<li><i>Manual</i>: An individual takes his or her hands off of the wheel</li>
 	<li><i>Cognitive</i>: An individual takes his or her mind off of the task of driving</li>
</ul>
Many distractions fit into more than one category, and all distractions endanger the driver, passengers and bystanders. According to the National Safety Council (NSC), distracted driving has joined alcohol and speeding as a leading factor in car accidents that result in fatalities and/or serious injuries.
<h3>Multi–Tasking</h3>
Using a cell phone (hands–free or handheld), a navigation system or any other device while driving requires the brain to multi–task — a process that it cannot perform safely while an individual is driving. In fact, according to the NSC, multi–tasking is a myth. The human brain does not perform two tasks at the same time. Instead, the brain alternates between one task and another. Since the brain can alternate between tasks very quickly, people believe they are completing two tasks simultaneously. In reality, however, the brain switches its focus between tasks so that only one action is accomplished at a time. In many instances, a driver’s response to a sudden unexpected hazard such as another driver’s behavior, a work zone or the presence of an animal or object in the roadway is the critical difference between a crash and a close call. When the brain is experiencing an increased workload due to multi–tasking, the processing of this unexpected information slows and a driver is much less likely to respond to a hazard in time to avoid a crash.
<h3>Cell Phone Use</h3>
According to the NSC, 24 percent of all motor vehicle crashes involve cell phone use. Drivers who use cell phones have a tendency to \"look at\" but not \"see\" up to 50 percent of the information in their driving environment, resulting in \"inattention blindness.\" The NHTSA estimates that, at any given time during daylight hours, approximately 800,000 Americans are using a cell phone while driving. Texting (or emailing or performing another action with a smart phone) while driving is particularly dangerous because it combines all three categories of distraction simultaneously: visual, manual and cognitive. When an individual texts, his or her eyes are off the road for 4.6 seconds. At 55 miles per hour, 4.6 seconds is the equivalent of driving the length of a football field.

While texting is a very serious problem, talking on the phone is just as dangerous. In fact, statistics show that individuals talking on cell phones are involved in more crashes than individuals who are texting (of course, this could also mean that individuals are much more likely to talk on the phone while driving than to text while driving). In 2010, an estimated 160,000 car accidents involved drivers who were texting or emailing, while 1.1 million crashes involved drivers who were talking on cell phones.

According to a recent AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety survey, 83 percent of respondents said that drivers using cell phones is a \"serious\" or \"extremely serious\" problem. In spite of this, more than half of the respondents admitted to talking on a cell phone while driving during the previous 30 days. This behavior was performed \"often\" or \"very often\" by 17 percent of respondents. Unfortunately, even when people are aware of the risks and dangers of a particular action, they may not easily change their behaviors.

Additional data regarding the dangers of using a cell phone while driving is extensive. According to Distraction.gov:
<ul>
 	<li>Distracted driving was reported to be a factor in 11 percent of fatal car accidents involving drivers under the age of 20.</li>
 	<li>Individuals who text while driving are 23 times more likely to be involved in a car accident.</li>
 	<li>Drivers under the age of 25 are 2 to 3 times more likely than older drivers to send text messages or emails while driving.</li>
 	<li>Forty percent of American teenagers say that they have been in a car when the driver used a cell phone in a way that put people in danger.</li>
 	<li>Drivers who use hand–held devices are four times more likely to get into crashes serious enough to injure themselves.</li>
 	<li>Headset cell phone use is not substantially safer than hand–held use.</li>
 	<li>Driving while using a cell phone reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prevention</h3>
Accidents caused by distracted driving are preventable. Distracted driving does not just happen, it is a choice — a choice that causes thousands of needless injuries and deaths each year. The most effective way to prevent accidents caused by distracted driving is for individuals to take responsibility for their actions and focus only on the road when driving.

Of course, there are individuals who will continue to engage in dangerous driving behavior and additional methods must be used as deterrents. According to the NHTSA, High Visibility Enforcement (HVE) is one such method. With HVE, police officials have a strong visual presence in a given area and are proactive in the enforcement of laws related to distracted driving. When the perceived risk of getting caught by law enforcement increases, the likelihood that people will engage in unsafe driving behavior decreases. Along with education and personal responsibility, HVE (along with related laws and consequences) has been shown to be an effective method of deterring distracted driving and reducing highway traffic fatalities.

Again, it is worth noting that cell phone use is not the only form of distracted driving. Drivers face many distractions behind the wheel. Every time that an individual takes his or her focus off of the road, he or she puts lives in danger. An accident takes only one split second and the consequences can be devastating.

To see the devastation that distracted driving can cause firsthand, please visit <a href=\"http://www.distraction.gov/content/faces/index.html\">Distraction.gov</a>. <strong>YOU</strong> are the first line of defense against distracted driving. Turn off your cell phone when you get behind the wheel and do not engage in any activity that distracts you from the task of driving. Additionally, if the driver of a vehicle that you are a passenger in is engaged in a distracted driving behavior, inform the driver that you do not feel safe. The life that you save may be your own.","What is Distracted Driving?","Common distractions while driving ","publish","open","open","","what_is_distracted_driving","","","2017-07-21 04:09:54","2017-07-21 04:09:54","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/what_is_distracted_driving/",0,"post","",0
1491,1,"2016-07-06 19:16:42","2016-07-06 19:16:42","The Association of Health Care Journalists (AHCJ) is a nonprofit organization that provides journalists with the appropriate resources to ensure that health topics are reported with accuracy and transparency. Their website contains a \"Statement of Principles\" which outlines methods by which journalists can uphold \"their professional standards of truth, accuracy, and context in every report.\"

While these principles are very important for journalists, they can also be helpful to all individuals who wish to identify quality health information.

Some particularly relevant highlights include:
<ul>
 	<li>\"<strong>Be vigilant in selecting sources</strong>, asking about, weighing and disclosing relevant financial, advocacy, personal or other interests of those we interview as a routine part of story research and interviews.\"</li>
 	<li>\"<strong>Investigate and report possible links</strong> between sources of information (studies or experts) and those (such as the manufacturers) who promote a new idea or therapy. Investigate and report the possible links between researchers and private companies, researchers and public institutions, patient advocacy groups and their sponsors, celebrity spokespersons and their sponsors, non–profit health and professional organizations and their sponsors.\"</li>
 	<li>\"<strong>Recognize that most stories involve a degree of nuance</strong> and complexity that no single source could provide. Journalists have a responsibility to present diverse viewpoints in context.\"</li>
 	<li>\"<strong>Understand the process of medical research</strong> in order to report accurately. Be cautious in reporting results of preliminary studies, in vitro or animal studies. Give accurate portrayals of the status of investigational drugs, devices and procedures, including significant caveats and explanations of hurdles, unknowns and potential problems.\"</li>
 	<li>\"<strong>Clearly identify and explain the meaning of results</strong> that indicate an association, rather than a causal link, between factors in a study. Remember: association is not cause.\"</li>
 	<li>\"<strong>Clearly define and communicate areas of doubt and uncertainty</strong>. Explain what doctors don't know as well as what they do know.\"</li>
 	<li>\"<strong>Seek out independent experts</strong> to scrutinize claims and evaluate the quality of evidence presented by sources.\"</li>
 	<li>\"<strong>Avoid vague, sensational language</strong> (cure, miracle, breakthrough, promising, dramatic, etc.)\"</li>
</ul>
These are only a few of the guidelines offered, but they represent an excellent subset of the Standards recommended by the AHCJ. By reviewing these Standards, individuals can identify the traits of responsible health journalism and look for the presence of these traits when examining information for themselves.

Of course, you don’t need to go it alone. While there is a wealth of content on your computer screen, on your television and in your magazines and newspapers, the most reliable health information results from the partnership between you and your trusted healthcare professional. By establishing a strong relationship with a well–trained physician, you can eliminate the guesswork and rely on his or her knowledge of a vast array of health information and — most importantly — his or her knowledge of the ways in which that information applies to <i>you</i>.

1492,1,"2016-08-30 19:16:44","2016-08-30 19:16:44","Research has consistently shown that numerous diseases, both common and uncommon, have genetic links.

According to the <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/familyhistory/\">Department of Health and Human Services</a>, diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia are just some of the diseases that can run in families.

By having the pertinent health data of an entire family in one record, an individual and his or her doctor can look for patterns or commonalities in health conditions among family members to help determine if there is an increased risk of developing a certain condition.

<strong>According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/public/file/print/FamHistFactSheet.pdf\">CDC</a>, additional aspects of a family health history that may indicate an increased risk of disease include:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The presence of health problems that develop 10 to 20 years earlier than would commonly occur among the general population</li>
 	<li>The presence of certain combinations of health problems among family members</li>
 	<li>The presence of a health disorder that does not commonly affect a certain gender (e.g., breast cancer in males)</li>
 	<li>The presence of birth deformities and/or developmental problems</li>
</ul>
It is important to remember that a family health history reflects more than just shared genes; it often also reflects a shared environment, lifestyle, and behaviors. Access to an individual’s personal and family health history allows a physician to fully understand and assess <i>all</i> of the factors that contribute to his or her current and future health. This information also helps to guide the physician in recommending screening procedures, follow–up actions, and/or lifestyle modifications.

Although it is not possible for an individual to change his or her genetic makeup, it is possible to modify lifestyle behaviors that can increase his or her risk for disease such as smoking, physical inactivity, and poor nutrition. It is also possible for an individual with a known family history of a certain disease such as colorectal cancer to receive certain screening tests earlier than recommended for the general public.","Why Is My Family's Health History Important?","Learn why you should take your family's health history seriously.","publish","open","open","","why_is_my_familys_health_history_important","","","2017-07-20 20:55:34","2017-07-20 20:55:34","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/why_is_my_familys_health_history_important/",0,"post","",0
1493,1,"2016-05-03 19:16:45","2016-05-03 19:16:45","When an individual has regular exams, his or her physician can compare measurements of weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and body mass index (BMI) over the years and address changes as needed. According to the <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002125.htm\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>, all adults — even seemingly healthy ones — should undergo regular physical examinations at their healthcare provider’s recommended frequency.

<strong>Aside from simply being recommended by the NIH, regular physical exams also provide the following key benefits:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Preventive Screening: Screening tests play a major role in the exam process. Even before risk factors are identified and/or symptoms are recognized, screening tests help to detect diseases in their early, most treatable stages and can even prevent disease. Many conditions and diseases are highly treatable when detected early.</li>
 	<li>Assessment of Risk Factors: Lifestyle behaviors, family health history, and measurements of blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, and glucose levels are all important indicators of an individual’s risk of developing certain medical conditions and should all be discussed candidly during an exam. Family history can influence the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and various cancers. Any new conditions or diseases that have occurred in an individual’s family since his or her last physical exam should be discussed.</li>
 	<li>Lifestyle Modification: Achieving a healthy weight, maintaining an active lifestyle, consuming a healthy diet with adequate fruits and vegetables, getting enough sleep, avoiding or minimizing alcohol intake, and not smoking are behaviors that have been proven to be essential to a long and healthy life. Physicians can address these behaviors with patients and both parties can then discuss related changes, opportunities and obstacles.</li>
 	<li>Vaccination Updates: According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6002a1.htm\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, there are a significant number of illnesses, disabilities and deaths that result from diseases that could easily have been prevented by vaccination. Specific immunization recommendations depend on a number of factors including age, lifestyle, high-risk conditions, type and locations of travel and previous immunizations, so it is important that each individual discusses his or her personal vaccination plan with a physician.</li>
 	<li>Physician/Patient Relationship: The most important part of a physical exam is the exchange of information between an individual and his or her doctor. Individuals should prepare for a physical exam ahead of time by collecting important information for the doctor including a list of questions and current concerns, a list of changes that have occurred since the last exam (including changes in family health history) and a list of current medications and supplements that they are taking. When a trusting relationship is formed, individuals are more likely to visit their doctor when they are ill and are more likely to comply with the doctor’s orders in general.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the Bottom Line?</h3>
The best way to prolong life is to take measures to prevent illness whenever possible. Having regular physical exams and leading a healthy lifestyle are the two most important preventive measures that you can control. If it is time for your regular physical exam, make your health a priority and schedule yours today.

1494,1,"2015-11-24 19:16:47","2015-11-24 19:16:47","The information age can broadly be defined by the famous Steve Jobs quote about “…standing at the intersection of computers and humanism.” This is to say that the prevalence of data processing machines in a society that bonds through the passing of information is where we are now, and will be for the foreseeable future.

While the ability to communicate and collaborate instantly across vast distances has been a boon, the access this has granted us to each other and to large data stores has allowed for a certain issue to arise: How do people with limited working memory behave when their lives have been integrated with machines which have unlimited recall?
<h3>What is Working Memory?</h3>
Working memory is the mechanism that allows individuals to recall and organize critical pieces of information, usually simultaneously, so that said information can be applied to a certain task. A common example used to illustrate working memory is mental arithmetic where a person hears two numbers and must add, subtract, multiply, or divide these numbers in their head and produce an answer. As the numbers grow larger, the ability for the individual to process this data and generate an accurate solution diminishes. This example can be contrasted with a computer which can take exponentially large numbers and perform calculations on them instantly.

In the APA’s “<a href=\"http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep05/workout.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A workout for working memory,</a>” two different theories regarding the limits of working memory were presented. On the one hand you had the theory of working memory being limited to seven different pieces of information at one time (such as recalling up to seven digits in a sequence), with anything greater having to be chunked (e.g., dividing a 10-digit number into chunks of five) for recall. This theory was contrasted with the idea that individuals can only retain one item in working memory, and the “n-back” test was employed to prove this. The n-back test, by the way, is when:

<img class=\"alignright wp-image-1761\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ThinkstockPhotos-186481600.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth200ampnameThinkstockPhotos-186481600.jpg\" alt=\"Think\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" />

<em>“The participants [in the task] read a series of numbers, presented one at a time on a computer screen. In the easiest version of the task, the computer presents a new digit, and then prompts participants to recall what number immediately preceded the current one. More difficult versions might ask participants to recall what number appeared two, three or four digits ago.”</em>
As you can imagine, the recall times varied when recalling the previous digit in a sequence and recalling the digit that was presented four sequences ago. In the end, however, the article revealed that a study was able to improve recall times after participants practiced the n-back test for 10 hours in a five day span, meaning that working memory can be improved. But is there a cost?

&nbsp;
<h3>Working Memory Overload and Cognitive Performance</h3>
In a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2854358/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study</a> found on the National Institute for Biotechnology Information, researchers utilized the stress placed on individuals during the n-back test and monitored subsequent cognitive performance. The results were interesting. As you can imagine, the recall times among the individuals increased as they were tasked with recalling numbers further back in sequence; however, what happened when individuals had to recall numbers four sequences back and then were asked to recall a number only two sequences back? The study finds that:

<em>“Overloading the working memory system with a high-load 4-back task induced a significant decline in subsequent working memory function and robust decreases in brain activity in various regions including relatively large areas of the pre-frontal cortex.”  </em>
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
With so much information being consumed by individuals at one time (count how many tabs you have open in your internet browser), it can be argued that many people place high-loads on their working memory at a pretty consistent rate. On top of that, information consumption and processing doesn’t only happen at work. As these high-loads of information recall have been shown to have a negative effect on cognitive performance, individuals should try doing one thing at a time.

In recent years, however, more and more companies are getting serious about the issue and are offering wellness programs to address employee health and wellbeing.

In June of this year, <a href=\"http://www.nationalemployeewellnessmonth.com/\">National Employee Wellness Month</a> – a campaign to help “business leaders learn how companies successfully engage employees in healthy lifestyles”- had over 200 sponsors. Workplace wellness programs are a win-win for labor and business. By avoiding disease and catching problems before they develop into chronic medical conditions, employees improve their lives and employers save on medical expense and gain productivity from less sick leave.  In fact, according to a <a href=\"http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/5345879/Workplace%20Wellness%20Programs.pdf\">Harvard University study</a>, “medical costs fall about $3.27 for every dollar spent on wellness programs, and absentee day costs fall by about $2.73 for every dollar spent.”

A recent <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR254.html\">study</a> by Rand Corp. revealed that about half of all businesses in America have some form of company-sponsored wellness activity. Larger corporations include broad wellness programming in their employee benefits package. Benefits managers across industries understand the appeal of a workplace wellness program to attract quality candidates and retain staff. A discounted gym membership or a granola bar in the vending machine will no longer suffice to enlist top talent. Workers will not be satisfied with a nutritious recipe in the monthly newsletter or daily email with “good living” platitudes. Employees have come to expect a complete wellness program offering, and forward-thinking business leaders understand that a productive workforce requires a healthy working environment.

Now that the idea of workplace wellness has become widely accepted, ‘wellness’ needs to move from a catch-all phrase to a sophisticated approach to <a href=\"../../../../com/eheintl/www/wellness.html\">preventive healthcare</a> in which employer and employee embrace and operate within the same culture of health.

Red Dress Campaign was created in 2003 to promote National Wear Red Day® and raise awareness about the prevalence of heart disease - the #1 killer of women. The centerpiece of the Campaign is the EHE International Red Dress photo.

This year's photo, which features twenty-eight EHE International women wearing stunning red evening gowns, was taken in front of the \"Rhythms of Infinity\" wall at 30 Rockefeller Plaza and will be on display in a window at 10 Rockefeller Plaza throughout February.

The window will also highlight a decade of EHE International's support of this very important women's health issue.\"As a national leader in preventive healthcare, EHE International is dedicated to reminding women to protect their heart health and take action before heart disease strikes\" said Deborah McKeever, president of EHE International.

\"Many people think that heart disease predominantly affects men. For 100 years, we have taken a proactive approach to preventing heart disease among both men and women. While it is never too late to make changes to prevent and control the risk factors for heart disease, the earlier in life that a woman commits to healthy living complemented by regular annual examinations and age and health appropriate screening tests, the better.\"

National Wear Red Day® promotes wearing red as a symbol, and provides an opportunity for men and women to unite in support of this life-saving awareness movement.In addition to the annual Red Dress photo, EHE International continues to demonstrate its passion and commitment to women's heart health. All women who participated in the 2013 EHE International Red Dress photo are EHE ambassadors who have learned about their own personal heart disease risks and are dedicated to educating other women about their risk factors.

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\"><strong>NEW YORK, NY (January 22, 2015)</strong> − A new study titled “Using Google Street View to Assess Environmental Contributions to Pedestrian-Injury Risk,” which collected and examined data of 532 intersections across all five boroughs in New York City using Google Street View has pioneered a groundbreaking method for researching pedestrian-injury risk factors on a much larger scale and at far lower cost than on-site inspections.
<!--more-->
<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica;\">
The study was conducted by Andrew Rundle, who serves on the Medical Advisory Board of EHE International, a New York City-based consultancy in preventive medicine, and EHE scholarship recipient, Stephen Mooney, a doctoral student in epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.

“This study and others that I hope will replicate and build upon have the potential to prompt public officials to continue to approve and fund infrastructure improvements to design better streets. Using this information, we can help save untold numbers of lives and greatly reduce the number of serious injuries,” said Deborah McKeever, president of EHE International.

The study’s unique methodology was aimed at ascertaining the feasibility of using information technology to make the process of analyzing intersections more efficient using less manpower, ultimately enabling vastly more intersections to be analyzed for safety hazards. “If you’re going to visit each intersection in person to collect data, it’s essentially difficult to study injury risk factors on a large scale in one city or across multiple cities within the budget of a typical research study. This approach accelerates research on how to improve neighborhoods to keep pedestrians safe” said Mooney.

Using collision data from public databases and other statistics the researchers identified nine underlying characteristics between the causes of traffic deaths and injuries and there they are happening.

The study found that the count of pedestrian injuries at intersections was associated with the presence (or absence) of marked crosswalks, pedestrian signals, nearby visual advertising (billboards), and bus stops. Other metrics analyzed included curb cuts, sidewalks, road conditions, and “traffic calming devices,” such as curb extensions and speed bumps.

Rundle added that a further benefit of intersection-safety hazards thus being identified and remediated would be that pedestrians would not only <em>be</em> safer, but also <em>feel</em> safer. “That perception of increased safety from traffic might in turn encourage more outdoor physical activity, with consequent physical and mental health benefits,” he said.

Expenditures on pedestrian-safety infrastructure upgrades may prove to be a particularly cost-effective way to improve public health. That’s no small consideration, given that an estimated 70,000 pedestrians were injured or killed by motor vehicles in the United States in 2013 alone. Independent of the Rundle-Mooney study, New York City has developed plans to improve pedestrian safety citywide. Under N.Y. Mayor Bill de Blasio’s ambitious “Vision Zero” initiative for ending traffic deaths and injuries on the city’s streets, the Big Apple has installed some 1,500 pedestrian signals and re-engineered dozens of roads and intersections.

The window was generously donated by EHE International to make people aware of the disease and help them get educated and take action.

The Super-Awesome Colon-O-Tron is making colorectal cancer something people will talk about with an eye-catching game encouraging people to stay lean, eat clean and get screened. The Colon-O-Tron will be in the 155-foot window at 10 Rockefeller Plaza through March 31.

\"Many people don't realize colorectal cancer is the second leading cancer killer of women and men in this country or how preventable and treatable it is. We're thrilled EHE International would partner with us to help everyone who passes through Rockefeller Plaza become better educated about this disease during Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month,\" said Catherine Montaldo, CCCF executive director.

The Colon Cancer Challenge Foundation began in 2004 with its signature event, the Colon Cancer Challenge 5k run/walk, and now begins its second decade by reaching out to more people than ever through the window and two Challenges in 2014.

It is because colorectal cancer is so under recognized as a health risk in America that EHE International's donation is crucial to support bringing awareness and education to the cause.

\"We are happy to do our part to help raise awareness on colon cancer and partner with the Colon Cancer Challenge Foundation,\" said Deb McKeever, president of EHE International.

MRY, the agency that designed the Colon-O-Tron, got involved after one of their employees was diagnosed with colon cancer in her 20s. Her involvement with the Colon Cancer Challenge Foundation spurred their commitment to fighting colorectal cancer.

PITMAN, NJ--(Marketwire - Aug 2, 2012) - EHE International and the Histiocytosis Association are excited to announce the unveiling of a window display at 10 Rockefeller Plaza encouraging everyone to \"Join in the Fight\" against histiocytosis.

<!--more-->

Characterized by a build-up of white blood cells known as histiocytes, histiocytosis is a rare and potentially fatal blood disorder. The window will prominently feature information from the Histiocytosis Association's public awareness campaign including the join in the fight against histiocytosis. The window will be on display for the public from August 2, 2012 until August 31, 2012.

\"This opportunity will raise awareness among the public about the plight of those individuals with histiocytosis and the need for federal research funding,\" said President and CEO Jeffrey Toughill. \"It is important to know that the pain and suffering experienced by people with this disorder can be just as severe as that of people diagnosed with more prevalent diseases, such as leukemia. With the help of the public, physicians, and the histio community, we are able to offer hope for better treatments and, ultimately, a cure for all who suffer from this disorder.\"

\"EHE is pleased to offer the Histiocytosis Association this window display opportunity in order to raise awareness about the need for more funds, better treatments and a cure of this rare, but often deadly disease,\" said Deborah McKeever, EHE President.

It is estimated that histiocytosis occurs in 1-2 adults per million people and 1:200,000 children are diagnosed with the disorder in the United States each year. Histiocytosis is classified as an \"orphan disease,\" because it affects too few people to receive substantial government funding for research. Through its annual grant program, the Association provides financial support to researchers studying the causes and treatment of the disorder.
<h2>About Histiocytosis</h2>
Founded in 1986, the Histiocytosis Association is dedicated to raising awareness about histiocytic disorders, providing educational and emotional support, and funding research leading to better treatments and a cure. You can learn more about histiocytosis at the Histiocytosis Association's website, www.histio.org. The site offers a variety of educational and emotional support services and information for patients diagnosed with histiocytosis, their friends and family members, physicians, and members of the public.

<strong>NEW YORK, July 1, 2013</strong> – EHE International has teamed up with The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society(R) (LLS) to shine a spotlight on blood cancers this July. For the entire month, the highly visible EHE International window at 10 Rockefeller Center will feature LLS's \"Someday is Today\" brand platform, including a 60-second video showcasing advances in funding lifesaving blood cancer research and access to treatments for blood cancer patients.

Statistics show more than 1 million people in North America are living with, or are in remission from a blood cancer. Approximately every four minutes, someone is diagnosed with a blood a cancer, and every 10 minutes someone dies.

\"The EHE International window display at Rockefeller Center helps LLS shine the spotlight on the urgency of finding cures for blood cancer patients and our impact on saving lives,\" explains John Walter, LLS chief executive officer. \"LLS exists to find cures and ensure access to treatments, and to advance more breakthrough therapies for patients with blood cancers. People talk about curing cancer at some point in the future. But, for LLS, someday is today. \"

Since its inception in 1949, LLS has invested more than $875 million in research to advance therapies and saves lives. LLS offers a comprehensive array of education and support services for blood cancer patients and their families, and as the voice for all blood cancer patients works to ensure access to treatments for all cancer patients. Survival rates for many blood cancer patients have doubled, tripled and even quadrupled since 1960, thanks in large part to LLS funding. But despite these advances, about half of blood cancer patients do not survive so more funding is needed to advance research.

\"In our continuous effort to help many organizations that focus on prevention and early detection, EHE International is delighted to support The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society in raising awareness for blood cancers. We encourage everyone to visit the window at Rockefeller Center, \" said Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International.

Detecting thyroid cancer, the fastest rising cancer among women in the United States, may come down to the simplest of tests: Check your neck. And, that is exactly what the Light of Life Foundation encourages people to do during Thyroid Cancer Awareness Month (September) and beyond. LOL encourages everyone to visit checkyourneck.com for more information. Doing so could save your neck-—and your life.

\"Early detection is key to diagnosing and treating thyroid cancer,\" said Joan Shey, president of LOL and a thyroid cancer survivor. \"So please check your neck, tell your loved ones and friends, and spread this simple message on Facebook and Twitter.\"

Thanks to the generosity of EHE International, a recognized national leader in employee and individual Preventive Healthcare Plan [PHP], which has donated its display window at 10 Rockefeller Plaza to LOL from November 1, 2012 – November 30, 2012. \"EHE is pleased to be able to offer the Light of Life Foundation this window to help raise the awareness about thyroid cancer and the importance of early detection,\" said Deborah McKeever, President, EHE International.

In 2011, at least 43,000 new cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed and treated. Because of the excellent overall survival rate after treatment for thyroid cancer, there are at least 350,000 thyroid cancer survivors living in the U.S. A 30-year survival rate for individuals with thyroid cancer is the great prognosis for more than 90 percent of those who have appropriate initial therapy.

Founded in 1997, LOL's mission is to improve the quality of life of thyroid cancer patients through continual education of the general and the medical community, and by promoting research and development to improve thyroid cancer care.

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\"><strong>NEW YORK, NY</strong> (February 2, 2015) — This year alone, nearly 370,000 American women will succumb to heart disease and stroke, along with 8.6 million women worldwide. Another 8 million U.S. women are currently living with heart disease after experiencing a heart attack or stroke. It affects one in two women and is the leading cause of death in women. Since 1984, more women than men have died, and while death rates have lowered in both men and women, rates have not declined as dramatically in women.</span>

<!--more-->

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">Life-threatening, but subtle, heart symptoms are experienced by many women. Knowing how to respond to those symptoms could save a life. This is the most important preventive message to women in the EHE International window display of the Women’s Heart Foundation.</span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\"> </span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">In a 2009 study, when the participants were asked what they would do if they thought they were having signs of a heart attack, only 53% said that they would call 9-1-1. \"Women may be uncertain if they are having a heart attack, don't want to bother anyone, and are embarrassed to call emergency services\", said Dr. Lori Mosca of the New York Presbyterian Medical Center. This delay in calling 9-1-1 has serious repercussions, she says, as it delays the chances for women to receive lifesaving therapies, and added: \"We still have a marked disparity in awareness among minority women, which is really important because they carry a disproportionate amount of CVD risk\". According to the National Institutes of Health, The mortality rate from CAD is 69% higher in black women than in white women; and 54% higher from stroke. Mortality for black females from hypertension is 352% higher than for white females. </span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\"> </span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">The Women’s Heart Foundation provides education on heart disease as it affects women differently and supports demonstration projects for prevention, with special focus on under-served minority populations. “We are advocating for research of new tools that can safely and more accurately diagnose heart disease in women. This is where the medical community is currently most challenged” says Bonnie Arkus, RN, president and founder or the Women’s Heart Foundation. “We are seeing more young people with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). African American women are at exceptional risk for CVD. These health disparities must not be allowed to continue.”</span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\"> </span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">It’s estimated 80% of heart disease is preventable, and can even be reversed through healthy lifestyle changes yet only a small percentage of government money is spent on prevention. “It is far more cost-effective to foster healthy living than treat a person in critical care suffering the horrors of a heart attack”, says Bonnie. “We’ve neglected to create or develop infrastructure to support healthy living. We need to win this battle, attack heart disease at its early stages, and empower women to make critical choices to prevent this devastating disease from occurring.” The Foundation seeks to raise funds to continue its mission of prevention and education.</span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\"> </span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">“One of the most important steps that women can take in order to properly care for their hearts is learning their risks for heart disease” said Deborah McKeever, president of EHE International. \"Our gift to the Women’s Heart Foundation will assist in expanding their mission of prevention and education, promoting awareness of gender-specific medicine and equality in heart care survival”.</span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\"> </span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">“We are thrilled and excited to have received the gifted window display for February from EHE International. This will allow us to reach thousands more women with the heart disease message”, said Ms. Arkus.</span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">The Women’s Heart Foundation’s (WHF) mission of prevention is achieved through education, advocacy and promotion of gender-specific care.  The Foundation also supports demonstration projects for prevention.

The WHF has conducted five national conferences on gender care chaired by renowned health leaders, and that were attended by more than 2,000 physicians and nurses. During the month of February, Heart Month, the WHF conducts and helps organize outreach in commemoration of its flagship program:  Women’s Heart Week February 1-7. From 2003 – 2010, the Women’s Heart Foundation implemented a highly successful demonstration project at a Trenton New Jersey High School, whereby improvement in outcomes was achieved by affecting health behaviors in at-risk minority teen girls. In all, more than 1200 students were served over a 7-year period. Hence, the WHF is expanding this effort with online tools available to schools who wish to replicate the program. A website was recently launched to offer new services: <a href=\"https://webmail.sherweb2010.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=wpgB3ue5dU62PpOSAZ43HQVduSFTCdIIkSXxRFTGZ7eufnQYuahkCbW3PWcR1gA_xvgjNKEon5g.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.heartfitkids.com%2f\">www.HeartFitKids.com</a>. </span>

<strong>NEW YORK, Aug. 14, 2012 /PRNewswire/</strong> -- EHE International, the nation's largest specialty preventive medicine practice organization, announced today that it has immediate market opportunities for qualified physician practice groups to join its private network to accommodate this growth. Entering its centennial year, EHE International is the recognized leader in employer-sponsored preventive medicine programs.

These programs are designed for the early detection of life-threatening chronic disease and its associated life-style behaviors by way of comprehensive physical exams and clinical counseling.
\"2012 has been a year of exceptional growth for EHE International,\" said Deborah McKeever, the company's president. \"This growth stems from Fortune 500 employers including EHE International's physician-led preventive care programs under their self-insured medical plans. Our clinical protocols are specifically designed for the early detection of disease and to identify health risks and lifestyle behaviors attributable to preventable chronic disease.\" EHE International's patient care protocols are developed by an independent Medical Advisory Board with expertise in evidence-based preventive medicine.

The company's private network of certified physician partners offering EHE International's programs spans 42 states. \"Each employee receives a comprehensive annual physical exam complemented by preventive medicine screenings that are aligned with their age, gender, family and personal health histories, and personal need.

Immediate new and expanded market opportunities for internal medicine, radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology specialists are now open in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

\"The rate of growth and demand for our services we're experiencing is unrelated to the recent passing of the Affordable Care Act, but rather comes from employers who recognize that their [often] long-standing inclusion of covered preventive benefits in their medical plans has not, cannot yield effective measures in cost reduction of preventable disease in of themselves,\" says McKeever. \"Since we first opened our doors in 1913, preventing disease been EHE International's philosophy. Seems like we were onto something then—and now.\"

<strong>NEW YORK, April 15, 2013 </strong>-- EHE International, a nationally recognized leader in preventive medicine and annual physical exams, celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2013 with the release of a new book, <em>100 Years of Preventive Health: The History of EHE International</em>. The book chronicles the company's rich history of helping people live longer, healthier lives.

<!--more-->

\"For 100 years, EHE International has been the standard-bearer in preventive health,\" said Deborah McKeever , EHE president. \"This book is a testament to EHE's lasting legacy in health care. Over the last century, our organization has adapted to changing times but has never wavered from our core mission: the conservation of human life and the promotion of health and longevity by the systematic application of medical science for the early detection of life-threatening disease through annual physical exams.\"

When Harold A. Ley and Irving Fisk launched EHE International (formerly known as the The Life Extension Institute) in 1913, Americans had an average life expectancy of just 47 years, and X-rays and surgical anesthesia were poised to revolutionize health care. Through the Great Depression, two World Wars and 17 presidents – including one who became the chairman of the EHE board, President William Howard Taft ; and one who followed the EHE diet, President Woodrow Wilson – stunning advancements in technology and science have completely changed the way that health care is delivered. But 100 years and millions of exams later, EHE remains the leading advocate for preventive health and the leading provider of physical examinations that identify disease and the development of health risks in the earliest and most treatable or manageable stages.

\"<em>100</em> <em>Years of Preventive Health: The History of EHE International</em> tells the story of EHE and preventive care in the U.S. with pictures and captivating narrative that highlight how far we've come as a country and the role EHE has played along the way,\" said McKeever.

As highlighted in <em>100 Years of Preventive Health: The History of EHE International</em>, EHE was among the first in the U.S. to:
<ul>
 	<li>Identify that 23 percent of draftees at the end of World War I were unfit for service due to preventable health conditions that could have been avoided through diet and oral hygiene (Dr. Fisk, 1918).</li>
 	<li>Discover the link between smoking tobacco and chronic diseases such as heart ailments and cancer 40 years before the U.S. Surgeon General warned of the dangers of smoking (1921, What it Costs to Smoke Tobacco).</li>
 	<li>Examine lost employee productivity due to preventable illness, concluding that lost man-hours were enough to complete 400 destroyers for the U.S. Navy (1944, Dr. Johnson).</li>
 	<li>Expand public health discussions to include sexual health, including the first look at the [sexual] habits of gay Americans (Dr. Harry J. Johnson , 1974).</li>
 	<li>Declare the full body scan to be an unsafe preventive screening tool three years before Columbia University found that the amount of radiation in one full body scan was equivalent to the amount of radiation received by Hiroshima survivors 1.5 miles from the atom bomb blast core (2001, EHE Medical Advisory Board).</li>
 	<li>Discover that the incidence of colorectal cancer is as prevalent among adults aged 40 to 49 as it is among adults aged 50 and above (2008, EHE Medical Advisory Board).</li>
 	<li>Discover the correlation between heart disease and obesity risk factors due to frequent travel among executives (2011, Dr. Andrew Rundle ).</li>
</ul>
In 2014, EHE will continue its tradition in historic research by publishing the largest study to date on the effect that a spouse or partner's health has on the other. The study will draw data from 6,000 couples.

\"<em>100 Years of Preventive Health: The History of EHE International </em>is our tribute to the men and women of yesteryear who set forth the EHE mission and led us to where we are today. As we enter our next century, we pledge to honor and preserve that great tradition,\" said McKeever.

<strong>NEW YORK</strong>, January 3, 2014—The Endometriosis Foundation of America (EFA) brings its powerful message about endometriosis, a debilitating disease that affects one in ten women in the United States and 176 million women worldwide to Rockefeller Center this January. In a window display donated by EHE International, a recognized leader in preventative medicine, the EFA will showcase its \"Killer Cramps are NOT Normal\" campaign.

If you have killer cramps, painful periods, debilitating leg or back pain, painful sexual activity or infertility then you may have endometriosis. Prevention and awareness are important, especially if you are missing school, work, sports, and time with family and friends every month.

<!--more-->

EHE International and the EFA have partnered to educate women about the symptoms and treatment of endometriosis, a disease that costs a staggering $110 billion annually. It is believed that there is a significant genetic component to endometriosis, as well as association with both ovarian and breast cancer. Thus, endometriosis presents a common and costly public health problem associated with substantial personal suffering.

\"We can no longer allow for women to suffer in silence with this debilitating disease,\" said Mady Schuman, Executive Director of the EFA. \"Our clarion call is to make sure that young girls and women worldwide know about this disease, its symptoms and treatment. Early diagnosis and early intervention are the best prevention.\"

\"EHE International is proud to support the Endometriosis Foundation of America with the launch of the 2014 window program to raise awareness,\" says Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International.
\"While endometriosis is one of the most treatable diseases,\" said Dr. Tamer Seckin, Co-founder of the EFA with Padma Lakshmi, \"it remains one of the most misdiagnosed and least treated. Misdiagnosis of endometriosis has led to unnecessary surgeries and hysterectomies, and the long-term use of powerful pain killers, hormones and other medications.\"

\"If I had been diagnosed at 13, 16, 25 or even at 30, that would have been 12 weeks a year, every year that my life would have been completely different,\" said Lakshmi, who was diagnosed with the disease when she was 36.

The \"Killer Cramps are NOT Normal\" campaign includes posters and educational materials that are being distributed nationally to high schools, colleges, doctor's offices, health clubs, and the likes.
\"Everyone needs to know about endometriosis. Thanks to EHE International we are on our way to doing just that!\" added Schuman.

To receive \"The Killer Cramps are NOT Normal\" poster and educational materials please contact the EFA at <a href=\"http://www.endofound.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.endofound.org </a>or call 212-430-0371.

<strong>About the Endometriosis Foundation of America (EFA)</strong>
The Endometriosis Foundation of America (EFA) strives to increase disease recognition, provide advocacy, facilitate expert surgical training, and fund landmark endometriosis research. Engaged in a robust campaign to inform both the medical community and the public, the EFA places particular emphasis on the critical importance of early diagnosis and effective intervention while simultaneously providing education to the next generation of medical professionals and their patients.

<strong>NEW YORK, NY (June 1, 2014</strong>) — One in three Americans is at risk for kidney disease. This month, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) is asking visitors to Rockefeller Center if they are the one.

<!--more-->Thanks to a donation from preventative healthcare company EHE International, during the month of June the NKF will use a high-profile window display space at 10 Rockefeller Center to promote kidney disease awareness.

\"Most people never think about kidney disease and yet 73 million Americans are at risk. Anyone who is over 60 or who has high blood pressure, diabetes or a family history of kidney failure, is at risk for developing kidney disease,” said Bruce Skyer, NKF Chief Executive Officer. “The message is simple. If you are at risk, you should have your kidney function tested annually by your doctor.”

The window display sends a stark, simple message to passersby and features kidney disease statistics and ways to support the awareness, prevention and treatment of kidney disease in communities across the U.S. The display was designed by the National Kidney Foundation’s creative services production staff.

More than 26 million Americans have kidney disease, and most don’t know it because symptoms don’t become apparent until the disease is advanced. Early detection and treatment can slow or prevent the progression of kidney disease.

\"Kidney disease is a significant public health issue,” said Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International. “EHE International is proud to support The National Kidney Foundation's efforts to prevent kidney disease in America. We hope this display sends a message to those at risk to get their kidney tested before it’s too late.”

<strong>About The National Kidney Foundation</strong>

The National Kidney Foundation is the leading organization in the U.S. dedicated to the awareness, prevention and treatment of kidney disease for hundreds of thousands of healthcare professionals, millions of patients and their families, and tens of millions of Americans at risk.

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">Together, more than 1.4 million people will be diagnosed with an upper GI malignancy annually. These are aggressive cancers with high mortality rates. Only 26% of gastric and 21% of esophageal cancers are diagnosed in operable stages, putting them both in the top 5 tumor types for late diagnosis (along with pancreatic, lung, and ovarian). Patients diagnosed with esophageal or gastric cancer have an 18% or 28% chance, respectively, of living 5 years after diagnosis. Stomach and esophageal cancers rank among the lowest of the major cancer types in terms of annual dollars dedicated towards research and development.  The DeGregorio Family Foundation strives to focus attention on these deadly diseases and to solicit donations to fight and eradicate them.</span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\"> </span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">As doctors and surgeons continue to see an increased number of patients with earlier stage stomach and esophageal cancer, the DeGregorio Family Foundation's funding of research grants is helping to turn the facts about these deadly diseases into fiction.</span>

<strong>NEW YORK, July 29, 2013</strong>— EHE International, a nationally recognized leader in preventive medicine and annual physical exams, today announced that it will expand its presence to all 50 states to meet a dramatic surge in demand for greater access to EHE's prevention programs. The expansion will begin immediately and is scheduled for completion by year-end.

\"EHE's continued expansion is a sign that more and more employers are realizing the benefits of standardization of clinically based protocols in preventive health and annual exams,\" said Deborah McKeever, president of EHE International. \"The traditional sick-care insurance model, which responds to developed health problems, is growing increasingly expensive for businesses. Focusing on evidence-based prevention with reportable health outcomes helps control future healthcare costs by catching problems before they become too serious, and contributes to greater employee job satisfaction and higher productivity among employees when they're engaged in proactively managing their own health.\"

For 100 years, EHE International has been the leading advocate for preventive health and the leading provider of comprehensive physical examinations that identify disease and the development of health risks in the earliest and most treatable or manageable stages. EHE-certified preventive care centers are now spread across 42 states. Approximately 50 to 60 centers are needed in new and existing markets to meet new business requirements effective October 1, 2013.

<strong>New York, N.Y. – February 1, 2012 – </strong>The women of EHE International, the leader in preventive healthcare since 1913, are at it again in their red dresses to raise awareness for heart disease. This year, the ladies in red are joined for the first time by the men of EHE International to bring attention to National Wear Red Day. The group comes together for the ninth consecutive year to shed light on the number one killer of Americans: heart disease.
The fashionable red attire of the employees symbolizes the importance of maintaining a healthy heart.

\"With one in every three deaths being caused by heart disease, it was important to add men into the equation,\" said Deborah McKeever, president of EHE International, of this year's Red Dress campaign. \"Wearing a red dress or red tie is a powerful first step that men and women can take to show they are taking responsibility for their heart health.\" McKeever said that EHE International encourages all its employees regardless of gender to celebrate the campaign by wearing an item of red clothing on February 3rd.

\"It is with great pride that EHE International announces the details of its 10th annual Red Dress photo shoot in continuation of its effort to raise awareness for heart disease in women,\" said Deborah McKeever, president of EHE International.

\"Far too many women believe that their greatest health risk is breast cancer when, in fact, one in three women will die of heart disease vs. one in 30 deaths from breast cancer every year. Heart disease is the number one killer of women, claiming nearly eight times as many lives as breast cancer, yet too many women go without potentially life-saving cardiovascular tests for the early detection.\"

Twenty-nine EHE International women will participate in this year's Red Dress photo shoot. Making a dramatic visual statement in the heart of New York, each lady will be adorned in a beautiful red evening gown that symbolizes the importance of maintaining a healthy heart.

<strong>NEW YORK, December 1, 2012 – </strong>A window display at Rockefeller Plaza this month will give the gift of hope this holiday season to children fighting cancer across the country by raising awareness and educating the public. The display was created to shed a light on the state of childhood cancer and empower the general public to make a difference in the life of children battling cancer. The window space at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, donated by EHE International, will house the display throughout December.

Cancer is the leading cause of death by disease in children in the United States. Each year in the United States approximately 13,500 children and adolescents are diagnosed with cancer. Over 40,000 children and adolescents are currently in treatment for cancer today. The average age of death for a child with cancer is 8, causing a child to lose approximately 69 years of expected life; yet, only 4 percent of the National Cancer Institute's federal budget goes to childhood cancer research.

Dena Sherwood, Founder of Arms Wide Open Childhood Cancer Foundation (AWOCCF) says, \"We are so thankful to EHE International for giving us this opportunity to raise awareness for these amazingly brave and strong children.\" She explains, \"Awareness is the key and the first step to putting an end to childhood cancer. Through awareness, the funding will come; the funding to provide trials and less toxic treatments to these children, the treatments they so desperately need in order to survive.\" It is AWOCCF's goal to raise awareness and educate the public, in order to be a voice for children fighting cancer so that they may receive the greatest gift this holiday season ... HOPE!

\"EHE International is happy to donate the window in Rockefeller Center for the month of December to the Arms Wide Open Childhood Cancer Foundation.

<strong>New York – March 2, 2012 – </strong> A window display at Rockefeller Plaza this month will emphasize the lifesaving value of colorectal cancer screening, reaching almost 250,000 people per day with this important public health message. A collaboration between the Entertainment Industry Foundation's National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance (EIF's NCCRA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Screen for Life: National Colorectal Cancer Action Campaign, the display provides facts about colorectal cancer screening to dispel common misconceptions that might cause people to forego a screening test. The window space at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, donated by EHE International, will house the display throughout March, National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.

Of cancers that affect both men and women, colorectal cancer is the second-leading cancer killer in the U.S., yet is highly curable when caught early and often entirely preventable with screening. EIF's NCCRA, co-founded by Katie Couric, works to raise awareness about the importance of getting screened and supports groundbreaking research to improve the way colon cancer is prevented, detected and treated.

\"EHE International is happy to donate the window in Rockefeller Center for the month of March to the EIF National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance. Together we hope to inform and raise awareness about the importance of screenings,\" said Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International.

\"While it's very gratifying that the colorectal cancer death rate has been declining steadily over the past few years, there's still so much to be done,\" said Lisa Paulsen, Entertainment Industry Foundation President and CEO. \"About one-third of adults who should be screened for colon cancer have not been, so we're always grateful for opportunities like this to spread the message that screening saves lives.\"

The display was created as part of CDC's multimedia and multiyear Screen for Life campaign, which partners with EIF's NCCRA on several awareness building activities.

<strong>New York – May 3, 2012 –</strong> Rockefeller Plaza Window Display Educates Public About Tuberous Sclerosis Complex A window display at Rockefeller Plaza this month will help educate the general public about a devastating and rare genetic disease called tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The display, created by the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance, briefly describes TSC and highlights the very first TSC Global Awareness Day, which occurs May 15. The window space at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, donated by EHE International, will house the display throughout May, National TSC Awareness Month.

TSC is a genetic disease that causes tumors to form in vital organs, primarily the brain, eyes, heart, kidney, liver, skin and lungs. It is also the leading genetic cause of both epilepsy and autism. Around 1 million people worldwide are known to have TSC, with approximately 50,000 in the United States.

<!--more-->

\"EHE International is happy to donate the window in Rockefeller Center for the month of May to the TS Alliance. Both organizations hope the display helps increase awareness of this devastating disease,\" said Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International.

\"There is currently no cure for TSC,\" explained Kari Luther Rosbeck, TS Alliance President and CEO. \"However, recent research discoveries and the approval of new drugs to treat the disease mean we are making strides to improve the lives of everyone touched by TSC. But much work remains, and we are grateful to EHE International for helping us tell our story.\"

<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>New York, NY April 1, 2015 –</strong> Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) joined with EHE International to unveil its newest advertising campaign at Rockefeller Plaza today with a message about helping veteran heroes who may exhibit the signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The window display, which is expected to be seen by more than 250,000 people every day, depicts service members and post-9/11 veterans as superheroes, with the message “Sometimes even heroes need help,” and directs the public to visit <a href=\"http://www.iava.org\">www.iava.org</a> to find resources to help transitioning veterans.</span>


<!--more-->

<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The campaign epitomizes IAVA’s work as the leading veterans’ advocate for post-9/11 veterans after the organization helped spearhead, craft, introduce and pass the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act last month, which increases access to quality mental healthcare and combats veteran suicide.</span>

<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">“More than 2.6 million brave men and women - including tens of thousands of New Yorkers - have served our country over the past 13 years, and we thank EHE International for providing us this remarkable space to recognize their service. There is perhaps no better place for us to salute these men and women than in the city that inspired many of them to enlist after that harrowing day in September 2001,” said IAVA CEO and Founder Paul Rieckhoff. “IAVA is proud to display this new campaign to the thousands of people who visit Rockefeller Plaza each day. Our veterans are indeed heroes, but they are not infallible. Some of us need help but are too proud or stubborn to ask. This campaign encourages the public to recognize the signs of PTSD in their friends and loved ones returning from war, and assist them finding the help they need. As the first and largest veteran empowerment organization for post-9/11 veterans, IAVA has a vast array of resources at its disposal to help veterans deal with mental health challenges and connect them with others in the community. Our veterans are not a charity; they are an investment. As the war in Afghanistan comes to an end, it is imperative that Americans remember the sacrifices of the post-9/11 veterans and continue to support them in their transition home. Being a hero doesn’t mean they have to suffer alone. Whether veterans are struggling with mental healthcare, unemployment, or VA healthcare challenges, IAVA has their back.”</span>

<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> </span>

<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">“EHE international is delighted to make this gift to IAVA. Through education, advocacy and community building IAVA empowers a generation of veterans who provide sustainable leadership for our country and their communities,” says Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International.</span>

<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">IAVA offers free membership to veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Interested veterans and supporters can visit <a href=\"http://iava.org/#join\">iava.org/#join</a> to sign up today. The organization also has an in-house case management team, the Rapid Response Referral Program (RRRP), where caseworkers help connect veterans facing transition-related challenges - including mental health challenges - to resources. Whether it is thinking about school, needing help navigating the VA, or confronting significant challenges like unemployment, financial or legal struggles, or homelessness, IAVA’s Veteran Transition Managers get veterans the services they need fast.</span>

<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> </span>

<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">IAVA is also a lion on the policy front in Washington, D.C. Over the past 10 years, the organization has grown to become the leading advocate for veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. IAVA has put top issues for veterans on the map and jump-started historic changes, including passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, funding for healthcare at the VA, the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, the Clay Hunt SAV Act and other efforts to combat veteran suicide, and, in 2014, a national focus on the high VA disability claims backlog.</span>

<strong>NEW YORK</strong>, Deccember 10, 2013—In response to a new American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) guideline for treatment of high cholesterol levels, EHE International Vice President of Medical Affairs Dr. Susan Spear issued the following statement:\"The Medical Advisory Board of EHE International has reviewed the guidelines, and finds the fundamental principles sound and very much in keeping with our approach. To treat high cholesterol effectively, each patient needs to be assessed individually based on family history, medical history and personal health behaviors. Then the patient and physician can come up with a treatment plan that makes sense and is realistic. Medication often plays a role, but the most effective, long-term way to improve health outcomes is through lifestyle changes. The new risk calculator certainly appears to have a role and benefit, but we can't confirm its usefulness without further analysis and prospective data. All we can say for now is that as an additional tool, it could be helpful.\"

The new guideline pinpoints four major groups of patients who can benefit from using moderate or high intensity statin therapy combined with lifestyle changes to reduce dangers posed by high cholesterol. The guideline urges doctors to focus on individual patients' health history and personal risk of heart problems. It also includes recommendations for a heart-healthy lifestyle, and a risk calculator.

New EHE-certified sites will provide thousands of EHE International members with greater access to EHE's leading preventive health programs, and allow them to proactively maintain their health.
\"EHE International had a banner year in 2012 as we continued to expand options for our U.S. members,\" said Deborah McKeever, president of the company. \"EHE members now have access to more doctors in more areas of the country, and in more specialized areas of preventive medicine than ever before.\"
EHE has 100 years of experience in caring for a company's greatest asset: its employees. By emphasizing physician-led clinical preventive care, EHE improves productivity, saves employers money and allows employees to proactively manage their own health.
\"We all agree that preventive care for our vehicles is a good idea,\" said McKeever. \"It's absurd that we don't think the same about our bodies. The good news is more and more employers are starting to see the value in fostering a physician-patient relationship at the preventive level as a means of keeping employees healthy rather than simply focusing on fixing problems.
\"The benefits of clinically based, standardized protocols in physical exams extend beyond the physician's office,\" added McKeever. \"It builds a framework to achieve maximum benefits from employer-sponsored on-site wellness programs. A doctor telling you that you need to do to improve your health is more impactful to personal health over that of a benefits or wellness program director.

<strong>NEW YORK</strong> (December 19, 2013)—In response to research recently published in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine </em>suggesting that multivitamin supplements are not useful in maintaining health, EHE International's Vice President of Medical Affairs, Dr. Susan Spear, issued the following statement:

\"It is important not to get carried away by broad headlines that do not take every individual situation into account and only offer so much information. While the findings published in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> do indicate that not everyone will benefit from multivitamins, the cases in question focused on select study groups that were not representative of the entire population. Every individual case is unique, based on a person's medical history, background, lifestyle, diet and other factors. Before determining whether to include or eliminate multivitamins from your nutritional routine, consult with a doctor who knows you and is familiar with your medical history. EHE recommends an annual physical exam and doctor consultation as part of any prevention or wellness program.\"

\"There is no magic pill that takes the place of following a lifestyle that includes a nutritionally balanced diet, sufficient amounts of physical activity and avoidance of toxic substances such as tobacco. That said, when over-the-counter dietary supplements are recommended by a physician or other qualified healthcare professional, it should be followed by a 'quality' discussion; not all supplements are equal.\"

<strong>New York, NY, APRIL</strong> <strong>2, 2013</strong>—As the leader for research in ALS, the devastating brain disorder also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, Project A.L.S. has been selected by EHE International to raise awareness about ALS and related brain diseases in a 103-square foot window display in Rockefeller Plaza. The interactive Project A.L.S. exhibit debuts today in the major international thoroughfare, and will be available to the public for the month of April.

The participatory exhibit focuses on ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and the closely related brain diseases that will affect 1 in 25 Americans by the year 2020. Scientists agree that if we can understand and treat ALS, we will have new insight into cures for the range of brain diseases. The display window, donated by EHE International, highlights the growing epidemic of brain disease by literally giving viewers a window into the human brain with information about brain disease and opportunities for visitors to participate in stopping its spread.

\"People need to realize that brain disease is going to touch each one of us,\" said Project A.L.S.

<strong>New York, NY April 30, 2013 – </strong>This May 22nd, the American Cancer Society will mark its 100th birthday and EHE International has donated a window at 10 Rockefeller Plaza to celebrate this remarkable milestone. Throughout the month of May, a 115-square foot display window at 10 Rockefeller Plaza will showcase a \"life list\" of NBC TODAY Show host and breast cancer survivor Hoda Kotb. Some of the major accomplishments on Kotb's life list are already crossed out, some still remain \"to do,\" and the last remaining item on the list is a goal to help finish the fight against cancer. The life list concept demonstrates how the Society is saving lives from cancer, and will mirror print advertisements featuring other life lists that will run in national magazines at the same time.

\"We know from 100 years of saving lives that silence won't finish the fight against cancer. This window will grab people's attention, amplifying our efforts to make this cancer's last century,\" says Kris Kim, American Cancer Society Eastern Division senior vice president of operations. \"The American Cancer Society has a longstanding relationship with EHE International and we're grateful for their continued support.\"
\"This year is a very important year for EHE International. As we too celebrate our centennial, it is with great honor that we present this month's window to the American Cancer Society, in recognition of its 100 years of saving lives\" said Deborah McKeever, president of EHE International.

<strong>NEW YORK, September 1, 2014 – </strong>The Bachmann-Strauss Dystonia &amp; Parkinson Foundation will be featured in a large window display at 10 Rockefeller Center throughout the month of September, showcasing its call to action—“Help Raise Awareness and Get Proper Care.” This opportunity to inform the public about dystonia, a debilitating movement disorder affecting some 500,000 men, women and children in North America, was made possible by a generous donation from EHE International.

<!--more-->

“EHE International is America’s oldest and largest health organization dedicated to proactive management of health. We are happy to donate our window to an organization that is raising awareness about dystonia and Parkinon’s disease, which aims to get patients the best possible care,” said Deborah KcKeever, President of EHE International. “Together, we hope to spread awareness and promote education about this disease, and help save lives.”

Dystonia causes painful, uncontrollable spasms, twisting movements and irregular postures, affecting many parts of the body. Because few physicians are familiar with the symptoms of dystonia, many patients suffer for years before getting a diagnosis. Dystonia has a close connection to Parkinson’s disease, which affects 6 million people worldwide. Some 40% of people with Parkinson’s disease also have dystonia.

The window exhibit will present facts and statistics about dystonia and Parkinson’s disease as well as descriptions of everyday challenges facing dystonia sufferers. It will also demonstrate the Foundation’s commitment to supporting research to develop improved therapies and cures. A large television monitor will outline how different types of dystonia affect various parts of the body and how dystonia, compared to other movement disorders, lacks awareness and research funding. The window display was designed and installed by Fashion Institute of Technology alumnus Sean Madden (Visual Presentation and Exhibit Design). We would like to acknowledge Mr. Madden’s time and commitment to this project.

The call to action includes a special invitation for patients: “We’re Here to Help…Get World-Class Care at One of Our Dystonia and Parkinson’s Disease Centers of Excellence.” These centers, established with grants of $400,000 each from the Foundation, bring together multidisciplinary teams to provide patients with coordinated care in a single location. The centers are located at Mount Sinai Beth Israel in New York; the University of Alabama at Birmingham; the University of California, San Francisco; and the University of Florida in Gainesville. For more information, visit <a href=\"http://www.dystonia-parkinson.org/centers\">www.dystonia-parkinson.org/centers</a>.

“I am thrilled that our Foundation was given this opportunity to bring attention to dystonia and its connection to Parkinson’s disease,” said Foundation President Bonnie Strauss. “Our biggest goal is to raise awareness about dystonia and Parkinson’s disease so patients can be diagnosed and treated earlier to obtain the best care possible. We’re also strongly committed to raising much-needed funds for research to ultimately find a cure.”

<strong>Short Hills, NJ (September 3, 2013) –</strong> The Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.ChristopherReeve.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.ChristopherReeve.org</a>), a national nonprofit dedicated to finding cures and treatments for spinal cord injury and improving quality of life for people living with paralysis, unveiled a 115-square foot display window today at 10 Rockefeller Plaza. The window space, which was donated by EHE International, will prominently feature Christopher Reeve's wheelchair throughout September, which is Spinal Cord Injury Awareness month, to help generate awareness of spinal cord injury and paralysis and inspire and galvanize passersby to support the Reeve Foundation's work.

\"We are proud to display the wheelchair Christopher Reeve spent the last nine years of his life in, paralyzed from the neck down after a riding accident,\" said Peter T. Wilderotter, president and CEO of the Reeve Foundation. \"Christopher always dreamed of the day he, and millions of others, might walk again.\"

<!--more-->

More than 5.6 million Americans, or one in 50 people, live with some form of paralysis. Of those, 1.275 million are living with paralysis due to a spinal cord injury.

Through their work, the Reeve Foundation hopes to educate the public about the extraordinary hope that exists in the here and now—research that is generating therapies and the programs that are improving the quality of life for so many living with paralysis today. At the same time, it's important for the public to understand that living well with paralysis is not just about recovering the ability to walk again. Depending on the level of their injury, people living with paralysis experience the loss of not just movement and sensation, but also bowel, bladder, and sexual function; breathing; and sweating and temperature regulation, to name a few functions that can be lost. Paralysis impacts life emotionally, physically, logistically, and financially.

Today, Christopher's dream of helping everyone living with paralysis is becoming a reality due to a groundbreaking new technique called Epidural Stimulation—the result of Reeve Foundation-funded research. Just as a body's power can be turned off, epidural stimulation enables it to be, in a way, turned back on. Small electrical pulses reawaken nerve cells in the spinal cord, reawakening functions like bladder and bowel control, sexual function, and sweating—and substantially improving an individual's quality of life.

The \"empty wheelchair\" window will be on display for the public throughout September to coincide with Spinal Cord Awareness Month, beginning Monday, September 3 and continuing through Monday, September 30. Appropriately, this includes the date of Christopher Reeve's birthday on September 25. The display was created pro-bono by a talented and creative team at BBDO New York, and is intended to both increase awareness of spinal cord injury as well as to encourage onlookers to help fulfill Christopher Reeve's dream by donating at <a href=\"http://www.ChristopherReeve.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.ChristopherReeve.org</a>.

\"EHE International is pleased to donate the use of this window space to the Reeve Foundation in order to raise awareness and funds for life-changing spinal cord injury research, especially during Spinal Cord Awareness Month,\" said Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International.
<h2>About the Reeve Foundation</h2>
The Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation is dedicated to curing spinal cord injury by funding innovative research and improving the quality of life for people living with paralysis through grants, information and advocacy. We meet all 20 of the Better Business Bureau's standards for charity accountability and hold the BBB's Charity Seal.

<strong>NEW YORK, Aug. 1, 2013</strong>— EHE International and the national Tourette Syndrome Association, Inc., (TSA) have unveiled a 115-square foot display window in 10 Rockefeller Plaza, created to generate awareness and acceptance of all people living with the much misunderstood neurological disorder, Tourette Syndrome (TS).

\"Tourette Syndrome ... It's Not What You Think\" is the message conveyed while asking the spectators to attempt to understand what it feels like to have Tourette Syndrome—to stop, and not move or make a sound-—the impossible task people with Tourette Syndrome simply cannot achieve. Symptoms of the disorder include sudden, incontrollable, involuntary vocalizations and movements called \"tics.\" There is no known cure and the cause of TS is still unknown.

<!--more-->

The window at 10 Rockefeller Plaza at 48th Street inside the \"Today Show\" plaza, donated by EHE International, will be on display for the public from August 1 through August 30.

\"EHE International is pleased to offer the Tourette Syndrome Association, Inc. the window space for use in their mission to raise awareness about Tourette Syndrome and help reduce the stigma associated with it,\" said Deborah McKeever, EHE International President.

Annetta Hewko, President of the TSA said, \"We are so grateful for this incredible opportunity to reach such a vast number of people on a daily basis. The awareness that will result from this display will undoubtedly create increased acceptance and understanding of Tourette Syndrome and the people who live with it.\"
For more information on Tourette Syndrome, call 1-888-4-TOURET or visit <a href=\"http://tsa-usa.org\">http://tsa-usa.org</a> and on Facebook and Twitter.

<strong>About the National Tourette Syndrome Association, Inc. </strong>
Founded in 1972, the TSA celebrates 41 years of service to the Tourette Syndrome community worldwide and has a three-pronged mission to identify the cause of, control the effects of and to find a cure for Tourette Syndrome through education, research and service. TSA has 33 chapters and more than 150 support groups throughout the country.

<strong><span class=\"xn-location\">NEW YORK</span>, NY</strong> (<span class=\"xn-chron\">October 16, 2014)—</span>EHE International, the recognized leader in preventive medicine and annual physical exams, today announced its proud support and sponsorship of American runner <span class=\"xn-person\">David Fouse</span> in the 2014 \"Himalayan 100 Mile Stage Race.\" Starting <span class=\"xn-chron\">Oct. 16</span> in Maneybhanjang, <span class=\"xn-location\">India</span>, and extending over a five-day period, David and his fellow runners will complete a 100-mile course that takes them to altitudes of 12,000 ft. with spectacular views of four of the top five world's largest mountains, including Mt. Everest.
<!--more-->

&nbsp;

\"The Himalayan 100 Mile Stage Race is an opportunity for EHE International to bring attention to the importance of encouraging employees to engage with their physicians to establish a baseline of one's physical health,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Deborah McKeever</span>, president and COO of EHE. \"David is able to pursue his dream of running in a race in the shadows of Mt. Everest because he was able to tailor his fitness goals after a thorough examination from an EHE physician. As David's exclusive sponsor, EHE hopes his example will inspire others to take charge of their health so that they can pursue their own individual goals.\"

A lifelong runner, David works full-time at a public-relations firm outside <span class=\"xn-location\">Washington, D.C.</span>, and is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU9j_w2Yyb8&amp;list=UUCEyTe4Gn6tz1f6ERMxWzTg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">father of five children</a>. While fitness has always been a part of David's life, he recently noticed that he was more fatigued and sore after his normal workouts. Earlier this year David completed a full-day physical exam at EHE's <span class=\"xn-location\">McLean, Va.</span>, location, where he learned that his body was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F046X-96xTc&amp;list=UUCEyTe4Gn6tz1f6ERMxWzTg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">healthy enough</a> to endure the rigors of high-altitude running.

\"I was concerned that my fatigue and soreness were symptoms of something more serious,\" David said. \"My first inclination was to do what too many 40-something Americans do, which is to cut back on living an active lifestyle. But after my physical at EHE, I learned that the only thing wrong with me was that I didn't have the body of an 18-year-old anymore. Otherwise, there was no reason I couldn't maintain my fitness regime – and even step it up a notch.\"

Running a 100-mile race through the Himalayas isn't for everyone. But too many U.S employees must choose between their job and living an active lifestyle. That they often choose to forgo physical activity to the detriment of their health is one reason EHE International has chosen to sponsor David and tell his story.

Employers who create a positive and healthy work environment generally see fewer employee sick days, and help build a workforce that is healthier, happier, and more productive. Whether it's a 100-mile race or a basic lifestyle improvement, it's time for companies to ask their employees, \"What's your <span class=\"xn-location\">India</span>?\"

Mr. Francis is the chairman of EHE’s board, and replaces the outgoing president, Deborah McKeever, who announced her retirement this month after 25 years of service.
<!--more--> “On behalf of the board and all of EHE, I would like to personally thank Ms. McKeever for her 25 years of commitment to EHE and exceptional service to our clients,” Mr. Francis said. “She has led this organization to new heights, and I look forward to continuing and building upon the solid foundation that’s in place. It’s a privilege to lead a company that is a trailblazer in preventive health care, and I’m excited to work with the EHE team to achieve our goal of becoming the nation’s pre-eminent wellness organization.”</span>

In March, EHE was acquired by Summit Partners and DW Healthcare Partners with a clear vision of expanding the EHE platform of preventive healthcare delivery. EHE is America’s oldest and largest health organization devoted to the proactive management of health through annual physical exams. Since the company’s founding in 1913, EHE has conducted their exam protocol for hundreds of corporations’ employees and partners to manage their healthcare costs through the early detection of preventable diseases and management of risk factors that drive those diseases.

“Shaun’s extensive business and healthcare experience makes him uniquely well-suited to oversee EHE’s continued growth,” said Mark deLaar, a managing director from Summit Partners. “As the nation’s largest provider of preventive medical exams, EHE is in a strong position to bring preventive care to the forefront of the national healthcare discussion.”

“EHE operates in an exciting and complex regulatory environment that Shaun understands well. Over the past few months as chair of EHE’s board, Shaun has gained critical insights and articulated a clear path forward for the company to build on its 100 years of success,” adds Andrew Carragher, founder and managing director from DW Healthcare Partners.

In 2003, Shaun Francis became CEO at Medcan, one of the world’s largest providers of preventive health care in Toronto, Canada. Prior to his role at Medcan, Mr. Francis was one of the founding employees and Senior Vice President of Strategy and Business Development for Dallas-based Broadlane, Inc., a leading business process outsourcer for over 900 American hospitals. Mr. Francis also worked for Morgan Stanley’s New York and Toronto investment banking division where he managed equity, debt and mergers, and acquisitions transactions. Shaun earned his MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor of Science with honors and merit from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

In addition to the new CEO appointment, EHE welcomed three new top executives to its growing organization. Brian Lantier joins as chief financial officer (CFO), Bill Stauffer as chief operating officer (COO) and Tom Maraday as executive vice president (EVP) of business development. The expansion moves EHE to an even greater leadership position in preventive care.

Prior to joining EHE as CFO, Mr. Lantier was with Wellspring Capital Management and was the CFO &amp; COO of Summit Golf Brands, a sports apparel company. Previously, he worked with AlixPartners' Turnaround &amp; Restructuring practice and The Staten Group, a boutique consulting firm focused on private equity portfolio companies. Mr. Lantier began his career as a naval officer and aviator, completing multiple wartime deployments supporting Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. He also served as the Chief of Flight Operations at Sikorsky (subsidiary of UTC) where he was responsible for helicopter flight testing on behalf of the U.S. Government. Mr. Lantier graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering and received a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School.

Mr. Stauffer joins EHE as its new COO. With more than a decade in the health and wellness industry, he was previously the executive-in-charge of operations and member experience at Equinox Fitness Clubs and SoulCycle, an indoor-cycling studio. He was also the COO for the premier juice-bar brand, Juice Generation. Mr. Stauffer earned his B.A. in marketing from Hofstra University and his M.S. in international business from State University of New York Maritime College.

Mr. Maraday brings more than three decades of preventive healthcare experience as the new EVP of business development. Prior to joining EHE, he served as vice president of business development for Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc. Before that, he spent 22 years with Plus One Health Management Inc. in a variety of sales, operating and leadership roles. Mr. Maraday earned a B.S. in human performance and nutrition from Southern Connecticut State University and has earned a number of industry-recognized certifications from Columbia University and the Human Performance Institute.

Commonly referred to as one of the most difficult sporting events in the world, the race is made up of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile run portion.
<!--more--></span> </span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\"> </span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">“The Ironman is an opportunity for EHE International to recognize those individuals who push themselves day after day in pursuit of a dream,” said Deborah McKeever, president and chief operating officer of EHE International. “For some, the dream is to finish the race, for others it’s to win. Regardless, their dedication to excellence and a vision resonates with EHE where for more than 100 years, we’ve pursued excellence in workplace health and preventive healthcare.”</span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\"> </span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">David works full time and is the father of five. Unlike professional athletes, he pursued his Ironman dream while maintaining the responsibilities of a business executive, father and husband. EHE sponsored David with the goal of inspiring others to pursue their dreams — whether it’s to run a 5k or to lower your blood pressure — EHE can help.</span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\"> </span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">“I’m so grateful to EHE for their programs and services in preparing for Cozumel,” David said. “Prior to 2015 I had never competed in an Ironman, so the challenge was daunting. EHE helped me prepare physically and mentally for the challenge. More than that though, by helping me reach my goals, EHE helped me encourage and challenge friends and colleagues to pursue their own goals for healthy living. I hope that more companies and their executives will contact EHE and become a prevention and health workforce advocate in their own areas of influence.”</span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\"> </span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">Competing in an Ironman is not for everyone. But too many U.S. employees must choose between their job and living an active lifestyle. When they see the C-suite engaging in healthy behaviors, employees become more aware of their own health, which is one reason EHE International has chosen to sponsor David and tell his story.</span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">Employers who create a positive and healthy work environment generally see fewer employee sick days, and help build a workforce that is healthier, happier, and more productive. Whether it’s an Ironman race or a basic lifestyle improvement, it’s time to for executives to “Ignite the Spark” in their companies. </span>

<!--more-->
Christine Keller and Brigen Winters, both partners at Groom Law Group and experts in employee health benefits, and Roy Ramthun, chief of policy and regulatory affairs for EHE, will guide participants through primary areas of compliance risk for preventive health programs, how to navigate new regulatory rules and requirements, and tips for keeping your company's health benefits compliant.

\"There's a lot of confusion in corporate HR offices when it comes to determining if certain health programs are at compliance risk under the Affordable Care Act and other federal laws,\" said Ramthun. \"The laws can be complicated and confusing, but ignorance of the law is no excuse. Corporate HR professionals must understand the important issues. This webinar will help those responsible for compliance better understand the requirements and risks.\"

\"We're looking to educate HR professionals on what the laws are and how they've been interpreted,\" said Winters. \"A lot of people don't even know what questions to ask when it comes to compliance issues and risk, and that can end up being a huge problem. We hope to clarify these issues in our upcoming webinar.\"

Key questions this webinar will answer include:
<ul>
 	<li>How much risk does your company face if you are not in compliance?</li>
 	<li>Are your \"executive health\" benefits discriminatory in any way?</li>
 	<li>Which benefits may be exempt from some of the requirements under the law?</li>

<strong>NEW YORK, NY </strong>(October 1, 2014)—Throughout the month of October, Susan G. Komen Greater NYC will showcase its work to save lives and eradicate breast cancer as a life-threatening disease in a highly coveted 10 Rockefeller Center display window, showcasing faces of breast cancer survivors and providing important messages about the disease.

<!--more-->

“One out of every eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime,” stated Linda Tantawi, CEO of Komen Greater NYC. “Everyone, male or female, knows someone or is someone who has been affected by breast cancer. It is an equal opportunity disease knowing no boundaries – not gender, geography, income level, or race. This generous donation <a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>by EHE International allows us to literally frame our mission to save lives and eradicate breast cancer forever.”

“EHE International is proud to support an organization that shines a light on breast cancer survivors, young and old,” says Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International. “It’s a privilege to work with an organization that is raising awareness to honor survivors and raise awareness, so more research can be done to find the cures. They are profiles in courage of women who face this disease.”

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and the second-most common cancer overall. In 2014, an estimated 232,030 cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. alone.

Tremendous strides have been made in breast cancer research and treatment. Over the last 30 years, the five year life expectancy for a woman who has been diagnosed with breast cancer that has not spread beyond the breast has increased from 74% to 99%.

The theme of the Susan G. Komen Greater NYC window is one of survivors. Featured in the window are more than a dozen portraits of breast cancer survivors, young and old, of many races, but all portraits in courage. These women are not just surviving but thriving, giving hope for all women who face this disease.

Photos featuring eight blood cancer survivors including adults, children, and their families are displayed with facts about LLS’s impact in funding research to advance lifesaving treatments and cures, and providing critical support and information to patients and families.
<!--more-->
“LLS has invested more than $1 billion in research to advance breakthrough therapies and cures for blood cancer patients, and has contributed to increasing survival rates; since the early 1960s, five-year survival rates for many blood cancer patients have doubled, tripled, and even quadrupled.

<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1958\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/DSC_0360.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth640ampnameDSC_0360-1024x571.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"446\" />

However, there are still more than 1 million people in the United States living with or in remission from a blood cancer. Every three minutes someone in the U.S. is diagnosed with a blood cancer, and more than one-third of blood cancer patients do not survive five years after diagnosis. Unlike other cancers, you cannot screen for or prevent most blood cancers. That’s why LLS focuses on cures. LLS’s mission is to find cures for leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin disease and myeloma, and to improve the quality of life of patients and their families.

“We are so grateful to EHE International for providing us the opportunity to remind the thousands of New York City residents and visitors to the iconic Rockefeller Center destination of the urgent need to fund research to find new and better treatments and cures for blood cancers,” stated Louis J. DeGennaro, Ph.D., LLS president and chief executive officer. “This eye-catching display is an unexpected way to capture public attention and create awareness of blood cancers and LLS’s goal to create a world without blood cancers.”

<strong>NEW YORK</strong><strong>, NY</strong><strong> (August 1, 2014)</strong>—Throughout the month of August, the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition will be featured in the highly coveted 10 Rockefeller Plaza showcase window. The space is being donated by EHE International, an historic preventative healthcare company, dedicated to proactive health care management. The eye-catching window display, designed in partnership with Stephen Pannone of DesignOjo, presents colorful flip-flops symbolizing women’s footsteps, in a ratio that denotes the alarmingly low ovarian cancer survival rate beyond five years.
<!--more-->

“The five-year survival rate for women diagnosed with the disease is only 44%. The associated impacts on families and communities make ovarian cancer <strong>More Than a Woman’s Disease</strong><sup>®</sup>. We thank EHE International for affording NOCC the opportunity to increase awareness, which is essential to saving lives,” comments David Barley, CEO of the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition.

Termed “the silent killer,” ovarian cancer continues to be the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers, affecting 1 in 72 women in their lifetime. There is no screening test for the disease, and it is undetected by a Pap test. The symptoms can be vague, and mimic those of unrelated conditions. As a result, most cases are diagnosed in later stages of the disease when the prognosis is poor.

Symptoms of ovarian cancer can include: bloating or sudden weight gain, persistent pelvic or abdominal pain or pressure, trouble eating or feeling full quickly, and feeling the need to urinate urgently or often. Helping to raise awareness about these signs and symptoms is integral to the mission of the NOCC . Where awareness exists, so does hope.

In that spirit, the window also features the PSA entitled, “Know Your Risk for Ovarian Cancer,” with Valisia LeKae, Grammy and Tony Award Nominated Broadway Star, NOCC National Spokesperson, and Ovarian Cancer Survivor. The video, provided by Mount Sinai’s Ovarian Cancer Risk Assessment Program, highlights the importance of knowing your risk as a key to prevention.

Also highlighted is the NOCC’s Run/Walk signature fundraising event, hosted by more than 20 offices nationwide in September, which is Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. These, and other events throughout the year, support the NOCC’s ongoing efforts to promote research, raise awareness, and provide education about ovarian cancer, which can lead to earlier detection and higher survival rates.

“EHE International is proud to support the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition’s efforts to raise awareness about ovarian cancer,” said Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International. “Together, we hope to spread awareness and promote education about this insidious disease, and help save lives.”

<strong>About the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition</strong>

Since its inception in 1995, the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition (NOCC), a designated 501(c)3 organization, has been committed to raising awareness about ovarian cancer, and providing support, education, and hope for women affected by the disease, and their families. The NOCC remains steadfast in its mission to save lives by fighting tirelessly to prevent and cure ovarian cancer, and to improve the quality of life for survivors.

“While it’s gratifying that colorectal cancer screening rates have risen steadily over the last decade, about one-third of U.S. adults for whom screening is recommended still haven’t been screened. There’s much more to do to make everyone aware that screening saves lives,” said Couric. “I’m grateful to the CDC for our long partnership in that effort, and to EHE International for its generosity in helping us deliver our message to the millions of people who’ll see this PSA.” </span></span>

<strong> NEW YORK, JANUARY 14, 2013- </strong>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a reliable indicator of obesity-related health risks, according to a new study conducted by EHE International Medical Advisory Board member Dr. Andrew Rundle. The study was published January 12 in Obesity Research and Clinical Practice.

<!--more-->

The study compared the merits of body mass index (BMI) to other measures of body size and adiposity as a predictor of obesity-related cardiovascular health risks. When compared with other measures including waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WtH), percent body fat (%BF), fat mass index (FMI) or fat-free mass index (FFMI), the researchers found BMI to be as good an indicator of clinical risks as the other measures of body size or composition.

\"There has been a lot of controversy recently over whether BMI, which is based simply on weight and height, is a good clinical indicator of obesity-related health risks, especially when compared to more complex measures and newer technologies,\" said Dr. Rundle, an Associate Professor of Epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"I wanted to see how well BMI performs compared to other proposed measures, and our research shows that BMI performs well as a predictor of health risks. If your BMI is high, chances are good it's because you have an excess of fat tissue and that you have other health risks. The data conclusively supports clinicians making recommendations for furthertesting and treatment based on BMI measurements, and patients heeding recommendations based on BMI.\"

Dr. Rundle conducted the research with colleagues Stephen J. Mooney and Aileen Baecker . They analyzed cross-sectional measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, percent body fat, blood pressure measurements, cholesterol levels and fasting glucose levels among more than 12,000 adults using information from EHE International's database of patients. EHE is a 100-year-old, nationally-recognized leader in preventive medicine and annual physical exams.

\"EHE was very pleased to participate in this study,\" said Debbie McKeever , president of EHE International. \"The successes of BMI in predicting health risks are an important finding that will help doctors practice better preventive medicine and allow patients to take a more proactive role in understanding and managing their health.\"

The study also found:
<ul>
 	<li>BMI is the strongest predictor of blood pressure</li>
 	<li>Waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio performed better at predicting fasting glucose levels, an important factor used to diagnose diabetes</li>
 	<li>BMI is roughly comparable to other measures at predicting cholesterol levels</li>
 	<li>Variables stratified by race and ethnicity had no significantly stronger associations</li>
</ul>

<strong>New York, NY, November 1, 2013 </strong>– Throughout the month of November, <em>Lung Cancer Awareness Month</em>, visitors to Rockefeller Center in the heart of midtown Manhattan will be educated on the number 1 cancer killer of Americans - more than colon, breast and prostate cancers combined.

Thanks to the generosity of EHE International, the Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF), will have a 115-square foot exhibit window containing important information about lung cancer. The exhibit will be on view at 10 Rockefeller Plaza from November 1, 2013 until December 3, 2013.

<!--more-->

The window display includes information about the disease, the innovative research being conducted, and startling statistics – including the fact that lung cancer is responsible for 1/3 of all cancer deaths in the US. The display urges anyone who wants to help support national research studies and activities focused on developing advances for better treatment, screening, and prevention of all cancers of the lung to visit the LCRF's web site at <a href=\"http://www.lungfund.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.lungfund.org</a>.

\"EHE International is delighted to donate the window space at Rockefeller Center to help educate people about the deadliest cancer in America during Lung Cancer Awareness Month,\" says Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International. \"We are very grateful to EHE for the opportunity to educate the public this devastating disease,\" says Sara Kirkwood of the Lung Cancer Research Foundation. \"Lung cancer research has been chronically underfunded compared to other cancers and the LCRF has been working to change this. This window display will give us the opportunity to deliver our message of hope through research\" said Kirkwood.

In addition to the display in November, LCRF will be hosting its annual lung cancer awareness luncheon, \"Perspectives on Lung Cancer: The Future of Lung Cancer Therapy\" on Thursday November 14, 2013 at the The Pierre Hotel, New York, NY. During the luncheon LCRF will be announcing 16 new research grants and will present the 2013-2014 Scientific Merit and Lynn Tarnopol Investigator Awards.

<em>Rockefeller Plaza Window Display Raising Awareness for Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Generously Donated by EHE International</em>
NEW YORK, July 3, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- For diseases that often go unnoticed, it may take a life-sized great white shark to capture people's attention. The Greater New York Chapter of the Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) unveiled a 115 square-foot display at 10 Rockefeller Plaza with a call to action to find cures for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The display, on view July 3-30, 2012, highlights the Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation and their work to find cures for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and to improve the lives of adults and children affected by these diseases.

<!--more-->

The window space was donated by EHE International, America's oldest and largest preventive health company. \"EHE International is happy to donate the window in Rockefeller Center for the month of July to the Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation. Together we hope to enlighten, inform and educate the public about the specific needs of over 1.4 million Americans suffering from Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,\" said Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International.

BOLD Worldwide, an advertising agency in Manhattan, donated its services to create the window's dynamic design, which features a four foot high great white shark. Brian Cristiano, CEO of BOLD explains, \"The window was designed to draw a parallel between pain, danger and the unknown. Crohn's and Colitis are relatively unknown and largely misunderstood. I wanted BOLD to lend support in helping to spread the message about these little-known diseases and draw attention to this worthwhile organization. I couldn't be more honored to be a part of this project for CCFA.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are painful, medically incurable illnesses that attack the digestive system. Crohn's disease may attack anywhere along the digestive track, while ulcerative colitis inflames only the large intestine (colon). Symptoms may include abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, fever, weight loss and fatigue. Many patients require hospitalization and surgery. Most people develop the diseases between the ages of 15 and 35; however the incidence is increasing in young people.

Featuring Academy Award-Winner Eddie Redmayne, the display is adapted from a public service announcement (PSA) by Stand Up To Cancer, a program of the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) and a 501 (c)(3) organization that, “raise funds to accelerate the pace of groundbreaking translational research that can get new therapies to patients quickly and save lives now.”

<!--more-->

The SU2C display shows Redmayne running head-on toward the viewer in the visual style of an action film while bold text reiterates the fact that more than 1,600 people in the U.S. die each day from cancer. That sobering statistic and the dynamic image together convey the urgency of getting new, more effective therapies to patients who desperately need them. SU2C facilitates collaboration by “Dream Teams” of leading scientists who work together to translate advances in the laboratory into new treatments for patients at an accelerated pace. Since Stand Up To Cancer was launched in 2008, more than 1,100 scientists from over 130 institutions around the world have collaborated through SU2C.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

“This is an incredibly promising moment in cancer research, but we risk losing that momentum if we don’t act now to support the scientists on the front lines of this fight and their life-saving work,” said EIF President and SU2C Co-founder Lisa Paulsen. “We’re so grateful to EHE International for the opportunity to share that message with the millions of people who will pass by this display.”

“EHE International is proud to be a longtime supporter of Stand Up To Cancer’s impressive campaign,” said Deborah McKeever, president of EHE International.

The window space at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, donated by EHE International, will house the display throughout the month of April. The display was created as part of SU2C’s Act Now, Save Lives, Stand Up To Cancer campaign, which is an exclusive short film and set of photographs shot by renowned photographer and film director Greg Williams. The campaign features Eva Mendes, Tom Hardy, Idris Elba, Benedict Cumberbatch and Michelle Dockery, among others, in addition to Redmayne.

Augie's Quest is a fundraising initiative that supports the nonprofit, ALS Therapy Development Institute (ALS TDI), in its mission to discover and develop effective treatments to end ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. EHE International donated the display space to help Augie's Quest and ALS TDI raise awareness of ALS and encourage participation in Zumba's campaign to \"make a move\" to support and fund drug development for the disease./p&gt;</p>
An estimated 450,000 people globally are living with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes muscle weakness, paralysis, and ultimately, respiratory failure. There is no effective treatment, and no cure.

<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">

Zumba's \"Together We Dance to Cure ALS\" campaign features three options to support Augie's Quest's mission to end ALS: attend a \"Together We Dance to Cure ALS\" Zumbathon® event in cities worldwide; purchase limited edition apparel and accessories; or make a donation.

Through the support of Zumba and other initiatives, Augie's Quest has raised nearly $40 million for ALS TDI since 2007 in support of finding effective ALS treatments. This has enabled scientists at ALS TDI to screen more than 100 molecules to see if they affected the progression of the disease, ultimately leading to a Phase II clinical trial that is currently ongoing on a potential treatment for the disease.

\"Zumba has been a key global partner with Augie's Quest since the beginning, and we are honored to have their continued support,\" says Augie Nieto, who heads Augie's Quest and is chairman of the board at ALS TDI. \"I know as people walk by the window display in Rockefeller Center, they too will be inspired to join in our fight against ALS.\"

This year alone, it is estimated that 1.6 million people in the US will be diagnosed with cancer. In fact, 41% of Americans are expected to receive a cancer diagnosis in their lifetime, which translates to 1 in 3 women and 1 in 2 men. A cancer diagnosis is a life changing event that often brings with it feelings of anxiety, distress and depression, and CSC firmly believes that these feelings are something that no one should have to go through alone.  </span>

<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica;\">The Rockefeller Center display will feature the words “Everyone knows someone touched by cancer. I am a…” It will include an LCD screen in the center of the display listing a rotation of answers to fill in the blank, “I am a…”, in order to highlight the fact that no one should experience cancer alone. This campaign is a continuation from CSC’s Spring Celebration in April where guests were invited to pose before a wall with the same words featured above them while holding a title card detailing their relation to cancer. From mother to son, survivor to caregiver, and many more, this campaign highlights the fact that cancer affects more than just the patient diagnosed, and there are communities of support for everyone. </span></span>

<span style=\"font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;\">Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurological disorder where the immune system destroys the protective covering of nerves, disrupting the transmission of messages that communicate a desired action from the brain, through the spinal cord, to various parts of the body. The course of the disease varies greatly from person to person. Common symptoms of MS include fatigue, weakness, spasticity, balance problems, bladder and bowel problems, numbness, vision loss, tremors and depression. Nearly 500,000 persons are impacted by MS in the United States. </span>

For one month (May 1 – 31), the company has donated the coveted window display space at 10 Rockefeller Center. The Foundation is using this space to showcase its <strong><em>Go with Your Own Glow</em></strong>™ campaign, which discourages hazardous tanning behaviors.
              <!--more--> <p>“Tanning is dangerous and comes with consequences, including accelerated skin aging, and even skin cancer,” said Deborah S. Sarnoff, MD, Senior Vice President of The Skin Cancer Foundation. “The Foundation would like to thank EHE International for this donation. What a great opportunity to further raise awareness about learning to love and embrace your natural skin tone.”</p> <p>More than 90 percent of the visible changes commonly attributed to skin aging are caused by the sun. Further, about 86 percent of melanomas can be attributed to exposure to the sun’s harmful UV rays.</p> <p>The Foundation’s <strong><em>Go With Your Own Glow™</em> </strong>campaign was created in 2008 and features beautifully illustrated print public service advertisements developed to encourage women to love — and protect — their skin, whatever its natural hue. <strong><em>Go With Your Own Glow™</em></strong> relies not just on health and safety information but also on fashion and beauty trends to convey the message that tanning is unhealthy and no longer in style.</p> <p>The window display art depicts a woman tanning on a beach towel. This image is supported by the tongue-in-cheek tagline, “<em>Keep Tanning. You Look Great in Leather.” </em>It was designed in partnership with advertising agency Laughlin Constable.</p> <p>“EHE International is proud to support The Skin Cancer Foundation’s efforts to raise awareness,” said <span>Deborah McKeever</span>, president of EHE International. “Together, we hope to spread the word that tanning is risky and passé.”</p> <p><em>Editor’s Note: Hi-res images of the window display art are available upon request.</em></p> <p><strong>About The Skin Cancer Foundation</strong></p> <p>The Skin Cancer Foundation is the only global organization solely devoted to the prevention, early detection and treatment of skin cancer. The mission of the Foundation is to decrease the incidence of skin cancer through public and professional education and research. Since its inception in 1979, the Foundation has recommended following a complete sun protection regimen that includes seeking shade and covering up with clothing, including a wide-brimmed hat and UV-blocking sunglasses, in addition to daily sunscreen use.

<h3>What Our Patients Are Saying...</h3>
<blockquote>After my physical exam, there was a follow-up appointment that I needed to make outside of EHE. I likely would have put it off, but I was contacted by Sidonia from EHE’s referral team and she was quite supportive. She set everything up for me with a facility that was close to my home. However, when I arrived for the follow-up appointment, I saw that the new doctor’s office had misplaced my information. I was frustrated and ready to turn around and go home. I then called Sidonia, and she was wonderful. She took care of everything while staying with me on the phone. I can’t say enough positive things about Sidonia and the ways that the EHE referral department handles their clients.
<strong>— Ann from Fair Haven</strong>

I have never really enjoyed doctor’s visits and have always been apprehensive in scheduling them. When I started working for my current company though, I had heard really good things about EHE so I decided to schedule an appointment and give it a try. In a nutshell, I was treated like royalty! It was like no other medical experience that I have ever had. It was a very professional atmosphere and it seemed that once I was done with one test, I was on to the next…everything was mapped out and timed perfectly. I have used this positive experience to change things in my life…I’m walking more, handling stress better and eating healthier. A lot of this is thanks to my Health Coach and the goals that we have set up.
<strong>— Gerard from Rockaway Township</strong>

I was pleasantly surprised at the high level of professionalism and comfort that I experienced while undergoing an annual physical with EHE. Everyone that I encountered was extremely attentive and pleasant and, even though it was a necessarily lengthy procedure as far as time is concerned, I felt that all aspects of my experience (tests, waiting time, filling out forms, etc.) were handled very efficiently. Even after the appointment, I received follow-up emails with great information containing not only detailed personal data but also many high-quality resources that I could utilize to promote my health and fitness. Thank you EHE for making this appointment as easy and informative as possible.
<strong>— Andrew from Hartsdale</strong>

The [EHE] exam seemed to go as normal, but the radiologist, Dr. Hamilton, noticed something out of the ordinary in my chest x-ray. There was a mass in my chest that had not been there in previous years. Dr. Hamilton didn’t know what it was, but he was convinced that there was definitely something there sitting on the top of my heart that needed to be removed. In order to have it removed, however, my insurance company needed me to have two more opinions, so I went to see two physicians that my insurance covers. EHE arranged a CT scan for me. The scan confirmed what Dr. Hamilton had seen, much to the amazement of the other physicians. Within three weeks, I had open heart surgery and the growth was safely removed … I can honestly say I feel that my physical saved my life.

Americans need to start eating healthier! You know it’s true and you’re totally on board, but despite your best attempts you haven’t been able to convince your family to eat healthier.

So, what can you do? Do you resign yourself to the fact that healthier meals just aren’t in the cards at your house? Definitely not! Where there’s a will there’s a way! Here are a few of my tips on how you can incorporate healthier versions of recipes into your meals and replace unhealthy snacks with healthier alternatives—mostly unbeknownst to your unwilling family!

<strong>Start with Breakfast</strong>

Are you or your kids addicted to sugary cereals in the morning? Try mixing in a little bit of a whole-grain, nutrient-rich, healthy cereal. Start with just a small amount the first few times, then, over time as tastes adapt, begin adding a bit more of the healthy cereal and a bit less of the sugary cereal. Some popular cereals also offer lower-sugar or whole-grain versions—just store them in plastic containers if you don’t want your kids to know.

If toast or bagels are popular in your house buy white whole wheat bread or bagels in place of regular white bread or bagels—they look the same as the white versions and have the same taste and texture, but have the nutritional benefits of whole wheat.  Just make sure the package says “100 percent whole grain\" or lists \"whole wheat\" as the first ingredient.  This is a smart idea for bread for sandwiches and hamburger and hot dog buns too.

When you have extra time and can make pancakes for breakfast, replace white flour with whole wheat flour or white whole-wheat flour (which is most like regular white flour). Or, if you’re worried everyone will notice the difference, start by using half whole wheat flour and half regular white flour to get used to the difference. To make them even healthier, use skim milk in place of whole milk. Or begin by replacing whole milk with 2% milk for a more gradual change.

Smoothies! You can make healthy low fat and low calorie smoothies at home and no one will notice if you add a carrot or spinach or cauliflower to the recipe (just don’t let them in the kitchen when you’re making it!)

<strong>Getting Enough Veggies</strong>

Does getting your family to eat vegetables feel like a battle you’ll never win?  Incorporate vegetables into meals with them never knowing:

Grate, dice or puree cooked or uncooked vegetables in your food processor and add them to recipes for tacos, meatballs, meatloaf, soups, stews and chili. You can also add them to sauces for pasta or as the base for making homemade pizzas.

Does your family love mac and cheese? Peel and grate some zucchini and mash up some cooked cauliflower and add it to the cheese sauce.

Add grated zucchini or squash to muffin mixes.

When making mashed potatoes, mash in some steamed cauliflower, or better yet completely substitute mashed cauliflower for mashed potatoes. Cauliflower has only 29 calories per cup compared to the 130 calories in a medium potato. Cauliflower is also packed with vitamin C.

Here’s another cauliflower idea. Try baked cauliflower buffalo wings in place of their deep fried chicken wing counterpart. The cauliflower version is delicious and much healthier.

<strong>Cutting Back on Fat and Calories</strong>

To cut back on saturated fats, substitute ground turkey for ground beef in burgers, meat loaf, chili, and tacos. Or, start by buying extra lean ground beef instead of regular to cut back on calories and fat. Also, remember to remove skin from poultry before cooking.

Do you love french fries (who doesn’t!) Try baked sweet potato fries instead-they’re delicious!

Buy “low fat” or better yet \"fat free\" dairy products—they provide the same nutrients as full–fat versions but have fewer calories and lower or no solid fat. If your family drinks whole milk now, start by switching to 2%, then gradually change to 1% and then skim. The same goes for yogurt, sour cream and cottage cheese—if you currently consume the full fat versions of these switch to low-fat versions before making the change to fat-free. Instead of ice cream, buy low-fat frozen yogurt or sorbet.

Substitute unsweetened, unflavored applesauce in recipes that call for oil-it’s easy and much healthier.

Don’t forget about your spice rack! Experiment with different herbs and spices to add delicious flavor to meals—they can replace calorie and fat laden sauces and gravies.

<strong>Healthier Snacking</strong>

You don’t have to grab a handful of potato chips to get you through until dinner or as a late night snack. There are definitely healthier and more satisfying alternatives. Here are a few.

Do you like cheese and crackers? Use low-fat whole grain crackers or better yet try using apple slices in place of cheese. Another option is to try apple slices with a little all natural peanut butter on them.

Air popped unbuttered popcorn can be a tasty treat when sprinkled with cinnamon or dark chocolate shavings or some parmesan cheese.

Used in moderation, a flavorful low-fat dip can make eating raw vegetables like carrots, celery, peppers and broccoli a tasty treat.

Freeze some grapes and snack on those when you have a craving for something sweet (don’t worry--they don't become rock solid when frozen!).

If you can get yourself and your kids past the green color of kale, try substituting home-made kale chips sprinkled with a little salt for potato chips. If that doesn’t work, try buying the baked versions of potato chips and tortilla chips—it’s a step in the right direction.

We all want our families to be healthy, and we all know that eating a healthy diet is one of the best ways to make that happen. And, it sounds good in theory, but the hard part is actually getting our families to cooperate. But as you can see there is no reason to lose hope! While you won’t be able to overhaul your family’s diet overnight, you can make small healthy changes they won’t even notice. So start today and incorporate healthier versions of recipes into your daily life and replace unhealthy snacks with healthier alternatives. You’ll be glad you did!","Becoming A Secret Chef","","publish","open","open","","becoming-secret-chef","","","2017-07-20 16:05:48","2017-07-20 16:05:48","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/?p=3035",0,"post","",0

<strong>WASHINGTON, D.C</strong>.-— Following May Melanoma Awareness Month, <a href=\"http://eheintl.com/\">EHE International</a>, the <a href=\"http://shadefoundation.org/\">SHADE Foundation of America</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.melanoma.org/\">Melanoma Research Foundation</a> (MRF) are partnering to bring vital skin cancer prevention messages to Rockefeller Center and its visitors. The window display, located at 10 Rockefeller Plaza and donated by EHE International, provides proven facts about <a href=\"http://www.melanoma.org/learn-more/melanoma-101/what-melanoma\">melanoma</a> (the deadliest form of skin cancer), the damaging effects of tanning and sun exposure, and tips for living safely in the sun.

\"Our support to the SHADE Foundation and the Melanoma Research Foundation will help educate people about the importance of sun safety. We are delighted to empower these organizations and look forward to increasing awareness as the summer season begins\" said Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International.
Incidences of melanoma, the fastest growing cancer in the world, have increased eight times among women in their 20s in just the last forty years. Additional research shows melanoma diagnoses are on the rise among teenagers. Melanoma is the most common form of cancer for young adults 25- to 29-years-old and the second most common cancer in adolescents and young adults 15- to 29-years-old.

\"One in 50 Americans has a lifetime risk of developing melanoma. These facts don't lie – our children and their friends could very well be diagnosed with this deadly disease if we don't do something,\" said Sue Gorham, Executive Director of the SHADE Foundation. \"It is absolutely critical that we share potentially lifesaving messages about preventing skin cancer.\"

\"If melanoma is caught early, chances of survival are often good with simple surgery. If caught in the later stages, survival can be measured in the matter of months,\" said Tim Turnham, Executive Director of the MRF \"We need to educate people about how to protect themselves from harmful UV rays and do their best to prevent a future melanoma diagnosis.\"

The window space will house the display throughout the month of June.

<strong>About the SHADE Foundation of America</strong>
The SHADE Foundation of America is dedicated to the eradication of melanoma through the education of children and the community in the prevention and detection of skin cancer and the promotion of sun safety. www.shadefoundation.org.

<strong>About the Melanoma Research Foundation</strong>
The Melanoma Research Foundation (MRF) is the largest independent organization devoted to melanoma. Committed to the support of medical research in finding effective treatments and eventually a cure for melanoma, the MRF also educates patients and physicians about prevention, diagnosis and the treatment of melanoma. The MRF is an active advocate for the melanoma community, helping to raise awareness of this disease and the need for a cure. The MRF's website is the premier source for melanoma information seekers. More information is available at <a href=\"http://www.shadefoundation.org/\">www.melanoma.org</a>.

<strong>About Melanoma</strong>
Melanoma is one of the fastest growing cancers in the United States and can strike men and women of all ages, all races and skin types. With a one in 50 lifetime risk of developing melanoma, nearly 77,000 Americans are expected to be diagnosed with the disease in 2013, resulting in over 9,400 deaths. Melanoma is the most common form of cancer for young adults 25- to 29-years-old and the second most common cancer in adolescents and young adults 15- to 29-years-old.

The majority of melanomas occur on the skin; in fact, melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer. Melanoma can also occur in the eye (ocular, or uveal melanoma), in mucous membranes (mucosal melanoma), or even beneath fingernails or toenails.","EHE International Supports the SHADE Foundation of America and the Melanoma Research Foundation to Raise Awareness for Skin Cancer","","pending","open","open","","ehe-international-supports-shade-foundation-america-melanoma-research-foundation-raise-awareness-skin-cancer","","","2017-03-16 14:39:06","2017-03-16 14:39:06","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/?p=3291",0,"post","",0

Today, the company celebrates its centennial and honors the guiding vision of its founders and the dedication of its employees by releasing 100 Years of Preventative Health – the History of EHE International, a book chronicling the company's evolution and significant contributions to the field of preventive health.

Set against a backdrop of major milestones in American life, this 120-page book engagingly interweaves EHE International's rich history with the personal stories of those who were inspired to join the organization in support of its mission, including former U.S. president and first chairman of EHE International's board, William Howard Taft.

<strong>NEW YORK, NY</strong> – More than 300 leaders in New York's fashion, philanthropic and lupus communities raised nearly $300,000 for the fight against lupus at S.L.E. Lupus Foundation's fifth annual New York Bag Ladies Luncheon. The support of the fashion industry with donations of over 150 handbags from 50 top designers seems particularly \"fitting\" since the devastating autoimmune disease primarily affects women. Held every spring, the luncheon celebrates a season brimming with the hope of promise fulfilled.

Honorary co-chairs were Matilda Raffa Cuomo, Former First Lady of New York State, Founder and Chair of Mentoring USA and opera legend Jessye Norman. With her commanding presence and majestic operatic voice, Miss Norman welcomed the crowd. \"Like many in this room, I have been involved in this marvelous fundraising luncheon since its inception. I am here each year on behalf of all the magnificent women with lupus who wage an unimaginable battle against this devastating disease affecting not only the bodies of women, but as often, their spirits.\"

This year's noted guest was fashion meteorite Alexandra Wilkis Wilson, who embodies the same pioneering innovative spirit that characterizes the S.L.E. Lupus Foundation. Ms. Wilson went from positions at Bulgari and Louis Vuitton to co-found Gilt Groupe, an innovative e-commerce company offering highly-coveted luxury lifestyle products. She noted, \"Three people near and dear to me suffer from lupus so I have seen some of the challenges it poses. Maintaining a positive attitude is not easy when battling such a difficult illness. But as someone entrenched in the fashion industry, I wanted to speak today to help inspire women to 'Dress for Happiness,' boosting their spirits and self-image.\"

Special recognition was given to Deborah McKeever, President and COO of EHE International for her help in increasing awareness of lupus through its highly visible Rockefeller Center Window Campaign. \"EHE International has been very proud to support the S.L.E. Lupus Foundation for the past several years,\" said Ms. McKeever. \"Our goal is to help groups build awareness of diseases like lupus that are not very well known but warrant public attention.\"

<strong>About Lupus</strong>

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or lupus, is a chronic, complex and serious autoimmune disease affecting more than 1.5 million Americans. Nine out of 10 people with lupus are women. In lupus, the immune system, which is designed to protect against infection, creates antibodies that attack the body's own tissues and organs -- the kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, blood, skin, and joints. Lupus is difficult to diagnose, difficult to treat, and a leading cause of premature cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and stroke among young women.","Fashion Industry Supports Lupus Science and Service with Style","","pending","open","open","","fashion-industry-supports-lupus-science-service-style","","","2017-03-16 14:39:10","2017-03-16 14:39:10","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/?p=3299",0,"post","",0

New York, NY – The S.L.E. Lupus Foundation put a face on lupus, with the unveiling of a 103-square foot display window yesterday at New York City's Rockefeller Plaza. Conveying the theme, \"Be the Face of Hope, Be the Cure,\" the window draws attention to the often undiagnosed and dangerous autoimmune disease.

The six powerful portraits represent the diverse faces of lupus -- men, women and children of all ages, and particularly young women of color. The photo collection also depicts a common dilemma for people with lupus -- many do not look sick despite suffering with the disease.

\"We designed the window to educate the general public about lupus so they know what lupus is and how it might impact people they know,\" said Margaret Dowd, S.L.E. Lupus Foundation and LRI executive director. \"Also, a mirror is prominently positioned to urge passersby to reflect on their own health. We want to encourage anyone who feels tired much of the time or experiences joint pain to talk with their health professional.\"

Thousands walking through Rockefeller Plaza will have that opportunity as they pass the eye-catching larger-than-life size window at New York's famous landmark, home to NBC Studios. Visitors can also learn more about the S.L.E. Lupus Foundation and support its services by texting LUPUS to 50555 to donate $10.00.

Often misdiagnosed and misunderstood, lupus is a destructive and potentially life-threatening autoimmune disease affecting more than 1.5 million Americans; nine out of 10 people with lupus are women. Lupus is a leading cause of kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and stroke among young women.

Up throughout the month of March, the space came to life with the creative vision of interior design major at the School of Visual Arts Stephanie Flores, who donated her time to help draw attention to lupus. For the fourth year, the nation's largest preventive health company EHE International donated the display window valued at $50,000 to $100,000 on the Plaza side of the building to help the S.L.E. Lupus Foundation raise awareness of lupus to improve diagnosis – and find a cure – for this difficult disease.

\"EHE International is proud to support of the S.L.E. Lupus Foundation once again by offering the Rockefeller Plaza window to raise public awareness and education about lupus,\" said Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International.

<strong>New York, NY</strong> – Proving that red is always in fashion, EHE International, a national provider of comprehensive physical exams celebrating its centennial in 2013, is commemorating the 10th anniversary of its Red Dress Heart Health Awareness Campaign.

The Red Dress Campaign was created in 2003 to promote National Wear Red Day® and raise awareness about the prevalence of heart disease - the #1 killer of women. The centerpiece of the Campaign is the EHE International Red Dress photo. This year's photo, which features twenty-eight EHE International women wearing stunning red evening gowns, was taken in front of the \"Rhythms of Infinity\" wall at 30 Rockefeller Plaza and will be on display in a window at 10 Rockefeller Plaza throughout February. The window will also highlight a decade of EHE International's support of this very important women's health issue.

\"As a national leader in preventive healthcare, EHE International is dedicated to reminding women to protect their heart health and take action before heart disease strikes\" said Deborah McKeever, president of EHE International. \"Many people think that heart disease predominantly affects men. For 100 years, we have taken a proactive approach to preventing heart disease among both men and women. While it is never too late to make changes to prevent and control the risk factors for heart disease, the earlier in life that a woman commits to healthy living complemented by regular annual examinations and age and health appropriate screening tests, the better.\"

Today is National Wear Red Day®. The day promotes wearing red as a symbol, and provides an opportunity for men and women to unite in support of this life-saving awareness movement.

In addition to the annual Red Dress photo, EHE International continues to demonstrate its passion and commitment to women's heart health. All women who participated in the 2013 EHE International Red Dress photo are EHE ambassadors who have learned about their own personal heart disease risks and are dedicated to educating other women about their risk factors.","The Women of EHE International Celebrate Ten Years of Going Red For Heart Health","","pending","open","open","","women-ehe-international-celebrate-ten-years-going-red-heart-health","","","2017-03-16 14:39:19","2017-03-16 14:39:19","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/?p=3305",0,"post","",0

<strong>NEW YORK</strong> – EHE International, the nationally recognized leader in preventive healthcare and annual physical exams for the last 100 years, today unveiled its 10th annual Red Dress photo and window display at 10 Rockefeller Center. The Red Dress Campaign and window display draws attention to the number one killer of women, heart disease.

\"It is with great pride that EHE International unveils its 10th annual Red Dress photo and window display in an effort to raise awareness for heart disease in women,\" said Deborah McKeever , president of EHE International.

\"One in three women die from heart disease. Heart disease continues to be the number one killer of women, claiming nearly eight times as many lives as breast cancer. Yet, most women do not know this fact and go without potentially life-saving cardiovascular tests that provide early detection. This is a trend we have to change.\"

Twenty-nine EHE International employees participated in this year's Red Dress photo shoot. Making a dramatic visual statement in the heart of New York, each lady is adorned in a beautiful red evening gown that symbolizes the importance of maintaining a healthy heart. All 29 women are official EHE ambassadors who understand their own personal risks for heart disease -- a chronic disease -- and the importance of annual examinations complemented by age- and health- appropriate screening tests and education. EHE is the only company in the United States to offer this comprehensive service to its staff.

The window display featuring the official 2013 EHE International Red Dress photograph and other National Wear Red Day features is located at 10 Rockefeller Center in New York City throughout the month of February. More than 100,000 people pass by the window each month.

Feb. 1 is designated as National Wear Red Day®. The day promotes wearing red as a symbol, and provides an opportunity for everyone to unite in a life-saving awareness movement by wearing red.","EHE International Launches 10th Annual Red Dress Campaign To Promote Heart Health for Women","","pending","open","open","","ehe-international-launches-10th-annual-red-dress-campaign-promote-heart-health-women","","","2017-03-16 14:39:23","2017-03-16 14:39:23","",0,"https://eheintl-com.snzpyws2-liquidwebsites.com/?p=3307",0,"post","",0

3372,8,"2017-04-20 19:51:09","2017-04-20 19:51:09","The first time I tried a box garden, I wasn't sure what to plant. I decided to go to my local farmers market and told them what my family enjoys eating and asked if any of those vegetables grow well in our area. I was in luck because lettuce, carrots, peppers, radishes, and tomatoes were on the list, and my family loves salad. And bonus, this mix of vegetables plants happens to be easy to care for!  We decided to start with a small box garden to give it a trial run the first year we did it.

From my experience as a beginner box gardener, here are a few tips to get started.
<ul>
 	<li>Box garden, well, in a box! If you don’t want to invest too much time, you can purchase a kit that comes complete with pre-measured and cut lumber and hardware-how handy! Avoid building a boxed garden on a wooden deck as the weight might be too much for the deck to bear. If you build directly on a concrete patio be sure to raise the box garden so there is proper drainage.</li>
 	<li>By design box gardens need little space. Make sure the location you choose will get an appropriate amount of sunlight and is close to a water source. Fill the box garden up to about three inches from the top with a good-quality mix of nutrient-rich soil and compost that is best suited for the plants you want to grow. Make sure it is level and smooth once filled. Keep the soil moist, but be careful not to over-water your garden.</li>
 	<li>Spacing of plants can be closer than a normal garden but don’t overdo it on the seeds. Standard seed packets will have way more than you need as I found out when I used a whole packet of carrot seeds and grew these teeny tiny carrots the size of my pinky. Your first season may be an experiment.</li>
 	<li>Family project. My kids loved running to the garden to snip the lettuce and pull the radishes for the ultimate fresh salad. We were even inspired to make our own fresh dressing (recipe below). Take turns with watering, weeding and harvesting. The pride of gardening is contagious and so is the love of salads. We are eating more salad than ever—even froze some tomatoes for the winter months.</li>
</ul>
Now, to keep the squirrels away!

3582,8,"2017-04-25 19:31:45","2017-04-25 19:31:45","I’m heading to New Orleans soon for vacation and I’ve been wondering how I’m going to eat all the delicious food the city has to offer without gaining 10 pounds!  Fortunately, I think I’ve found the answer. It turns out that there are a ton of walking tours I can take to stay active. I can tour the French Quarter, the Garden District, St. Louis Cemetery…. I can even take a ghost tour. Now I won’t have to feel guilty when I have a beignet with my coffee every morning at breakfast!

I’m really excited about my new discovery. I had never considered a walking tour before, but since my interest was piqued, I’ve done a little digging. So, if you, like me, are new to the world of walking tours, here’s some information you might find helpful:
<ul>
 	<li>Walking tours are available just about everywhere--New York, Montreal, San Antonio, Tuscany, and even Tuscaloosa! Big cities aren’t the only place you can take a walking tour—there are many small historic towns across the world that also have a lot to offer. All it usually takes to find one is a quick web search or a call to the local tourism office for information. For larger cities buying a guidebook can also help.</li>
 	<li>You can opt for a self-guided tour or you can hire a guide. The benefit to having a knowledgeable tour guide is that you don’t have to do any research or planning--all you have to do is show up. The tour guide will make sure you see all the main sights there are to see as well as the not so well-known gems that only a local would know about. You will also be able to ask questions which may not be easily answered using a guide book. Another bonus is that a guide can give you tips on more places to visit, what to avoid, and where to eat. A self-guided tour is also an option—it just requires more advanced planning and it allows you to explore at your own pace.</li>
 	<li>Guided tours don’t have to be expensive! I was surprised to find out that many guided tours don’t charge a set fee—they often require a reservation, but they only ask that you leave an appropriate tip for your guide based on what you thought the tour was worth. This encourages tour guides to provide the best possible experience. If you’re visiting a major city, a helpful site to find free walking tours is <a href=\"http://www.freetoursbyfoot.com/\">Free Tours by Foot</a>.</li>
 	<li>Walking tours come in different shapes and sizes! They can be short or long, easy or difficult. And, depending on your destination, there may be multiple kinds of walking tours to take. Many larger cities have a variety of options —you can focus on history one day, architecture the next, then art, food, culture, etc. By the end of your trip you’ll be an expert!</li>
</ul>
Walking tours seem to be a great way to get an up close look at an unfamiliar place with the added bonus of plenty of fresh air and exercise! It’s also occurred to me that I don’t have to travel far to go on a walking tour…. it’s finally springtime…a perfect time for me to get up close and personal in my own area. I live in a small historic town in upstate New York and it turns out there are quite a few walking tours I never knew existed. So don't think you have to travel far afield to take advantage of walking tours. If you don't have a trip planned, play tourist in your own town--you may discover things you never knew existed!","Walking Tours","","publish","open","open","","walking-tours","","","2017-07-20 16:01:23","2017-07-20 16:01:23","",0,"https://www.eheintl.com/?p=3582",0,"post","",0

3608,8,"2017-05-09 15:48:42","2017-05-09 15:48:42","Are you bored with your exercise routine? Tired of staring at the TV while on the elliptical or treadmill? Did you play sports your whole life until the reality of adulthood and a 9 to 5 job brought playing to a grinding halt? If any of these scenarios sound familiar to you, it might be time to shake up your routine and join an adult sports team! Even if you’ve never set foot on a court, field or diamond, if there’s a sport you’ve always wanted to play but never learned, joining an adult sport league can be a great way to learn a new skill, exercise and have fun! If this sounds like something you’d like to try, you most likely have a lot of questions. What sport should you play? Where are you going to find a team? What if you’ve never played before? Read on for some tips on what you could play, where to look and what to expect.

<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3610 alignleft\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Dodgeball-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />

The good news is that depending on where you live and work, there are often quite a few sports and activities to choose from--volleyball, softball, basketball, soccer and even kickball, dodgeball and ultimate frisbee! Start by checking with your local YMCA or your city’s parks and recreation department—they often have leagues already set up. There’s usually a fee to play but it is relatively inexpensive. Another possibility is to ask if your job has any workplace sponsored teams you could join. And if those don’t yield results, do an internet search for phrases like “adult basketball league in (your city)” or “coed softball league in (your city)” as these will often produce good results.

If you’re just a beginner and worried about not being good enough for a team, don’t let that stop you! Some leagues have different levels of play available from beginner to more advanced. My city for example, has beginner, intermediate and advanced divisions in its volleyball league.  Start out in the beginner league and as you improve you can move on to the next level of play. Or start with something that doesn’t require a lot of athletic prowess, like kickball! You can go to <a href=\"http://www.kickball.com/searchzip\">WAKA</a> and put in your zip code to see if there are any leagues near you! (I just did it and found 1 locally and 2 others within an hour of my house!)

Although joining a team may sound appealing, you may be wondering if it is really practical. Between work and family obligations who has the time for this? But remember that everyone else is dealing with time constraints too, so you can probably find something that will work with your schedule.

If you’re still not convinced to give it a try, consider these benefits of joining an adult sports league that you may not have considered. You can:

<em>Meet new people and expand your social circle:</em> Joining a team is a great way to meet people and make new friends. You already know you share at least one interest with the other members of your team, so it’s a good way to break the ice and get to know your teammates even better. There’s nothing quite like the camaraderie you build through teamwork on the playing field.

<em>Relieve stress:</em> Playing in a basketball game or a beach volleyball game (or whatever your sport of

choice is!) can be a great way to de-stress and blow off steam after a long day at work. It gives you the opportunity to get away from it all and escape from the routine of the workweek and the worries of daily life. I think we could all use a healthy escape like this from time to time!

<em>Have fun!:</em> The importance of play doesn’t end with childhood. Sometimes we forget this as we grow older. Play bring joy and who doesn’t want more joy in their life? When you’re having fun playing a team sport you are engaged and connected and these feelings can be a tremendous boost to your mental health.

<em>Variety:</em> Going to the gym every day or for a jog is certainly admirable and great for your health, but it’s also good to mix things up once in a while. When you play a team sport you’ll add variety to your workouts, you’ll get a change of scenery and you may have so much fun that you forget you’re exercising!

Of course, you can’t overlook the very important fact that when you are physically active you are healthier. And we are all more likely to be physically active and <em>stay</em> physically active when we enjoy what we are doing! That’s why joining a sports league may be just the thing--not only will you get moving and reap the physical benefits of exercise, you’ll have fun doing it!","Should You Join an Adult Recreational Sports Team?","","publish","open","open","","join-adult-recreational-sports-team","","","2017-07-20 15:53:13","2017-07-20 15:53:13","",0,"https://www.eheintl.com/?p=3608",0,"post","",0

3622,8,"2017-05-24 16:55:55","2017-05-24 16:55:55","Seasonal allergies touch the lives of most of us at some point. According to the CDC, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/allergies.htm\">20 million adults in the US have been diagnosed with hay fever in the past 12 months</a>.

Spring seasonal allergies can start as early as February and can last well into the summer. Trees that produce large amounts of pollen are one of the main triggers. A particularly rainy spring or mild winter can cause trees and plants to grow more rapidly, producing larger amounts of pollen and leading to a more severe allergy season. This can also cause an increase in the growth of mold spores which are another major allergen.

<strong>10 Major Symptoms of Seasonal Allergies</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>Coughing</li>
 	<li>Sneezing</li>
 	<li>Nasal congestion or runny nose</li>
 	<li>Postnasal drip</li>
 	<li>Fatigue or low energy</li>
 	<li>Itchy, red or swollen eyes</li>
 	<li>Watery eyes</li>
 	<li>Allergic Shiners (dark circles under the eyes as a result of congestion)</li>
 	<li>Itchy throat or roof of the mouth</li>
 	<li>Rash or itchy skin</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who is Susceptible to Seasonal Allergies?</h3>
Anyone can develop seasonal allergies during various stages of life. A child may grow out of their allergies by adulthood. Allergens triggering major reactions may diminish or increase from season to season. And moving from one climate to another could cause you to develop allergies that perhaps you were never aware of.

<strong>How to Prepare for Seasonal Allergies</strong>

One of the best ways to ease the affect of your seasonal allergies is to keep an eye on <a href=\"https://weather.com/forecast/allergy/l/USDC0001:1:US\">the pollen and mold spore counts</a> which are normally announced in newspapers or news broadcasts during the allergy season.

Keep your windows closed during the season and run the air-conditioner during days with particularly high pollen counts. You may also consider a home air filter or air purifier.

<strong>Prevention of Seasonal Allergies</strong>

Allergies are not preventable, but your allergic reactions can be minimized. The best form of prevention is understanding what triggers or causes your allergies. Visiting an allergist can help you determine your triggers and prescribe treatment. An allergist may prescribe medications or help you with advice on avoiding allergens such as remaining in an air-conditioned area during days with particularly high pollen counts.

Seasonal allergies may be something you have to live with over the course of your life, but you don’t have to suffer. By preparing for the season, understanding your triggers, and through the use of medications or avoidance, you can make your seasonal allergies much more bearable.

3626,8,"2017-05-24 17:00:10","2017-05-24 17:00:10","A physical examination is more than a check-up; it’s one of the best ways to boost longevity and health in the long term by committing to preventative care and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/dont-fear-medical-screenings/\">medical screenings</a>. Proactive measures help you and your doctor identify potential health risks, making it easier to avoid and interrupt chronic illness before it takes hold. This is why it is important to see your doctor for <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/preventive-exams-not-a-c-suite-luxury/\">annual physical exams</a>.

We know that visiting the doctor is intimidating for many, and we encourage you to confront any fear you may be feeling and make the appointment. Your doctor is a partner in creating good long-term health outcomes, and the peace of mind which comes from taking positive action is worth the nerves and effort.

While overcoming fear of doctor’s visits sounds great in theory, in practice it feels overwhelming for some at first. <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/attacking_anxiety_with-actionandawareness/\">Anxiety</a> about medical care is common, and can be difficult to manage at times. When calling to make your medical appointments, it is helpful to communicate your concerns to the individuals responsible for scheduling. Maybe you have a fear of needles, and you want to ensure you are seen by your doctor’s best and most sensitive phlebotomist. By communicating your needs to your care providers, you give them the opportunity to accommodate you and make your visit as comfortable as possible.

<strong>Happy Side Effect of a Physical Examination</strong>

It is important to remember that scheduling an annual physical examination is just one part of making the commitment to self-care and better health choices. Lifestyle habits such as exercise, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/how_to_keep_good_sleep_hygiene/\">proper sleep habits / hygiene</a>, nutrition, stress management, and medical care are all key to supporting your health over time.

As you learn to find ways <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/how-to-make-lasting-change/\">to commit to lasting change</a>, you can be sure that your efforts will pay off. Benefits such as better sleep, healthier body weight, increased energy, and better mental clarity result from taking charge of your health and well-being.

</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Preventative care will help decrease and ease anxiety over time by protecting your health in the long term.</li>
 	<li>A proactive approach to health care includes developing healthier lifestyle habits such as exercise, sleep hygiene, and stress management which contribute to the prevention of many chronic and degenerative diseases.</li>
 	<li>Preventative medical screenings help protect your financial future. Illness is far less expensive to prevent than it is to treat.</li>
 	<li>Annual medical screenings actually reduce your time spent in the doctor’s office by decreasing the likelihood of more complex illnesses developing over time.</li>
</ul>
<strong> Action Steps: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Choose a type of <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/health-benefits-of-exercise-is-a-fountain-of-youth/\">exercise</a> you enjoy, and commit to it at least three times per week.</li>
 	<li>See your doctor regularly for physical exams.</li>
 	<li>Eat a nourishing and balanced diet based in whole, natural, and minimally processed foods.</li>
 	<li>Do not smoke. If you do smoke, talk with your doctor about the right <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/quick_thought_smoking_cessation/\">smoking cessation</a> program for you.</li>
 	<li>Drink alcohol in moderation or not at all.</li>
 	<li>Get at least seven to eight hours of sleep each night. Turn off your phone and electronic devices at least one hour before bed, and sleep in a well darkened room.</li>
</ul>
Remember that your health and peace of mind are worth the effort it takes to protect them, so we encourage a proactive approach. Know that any anxiety you may feel about seeing your doctor is understandable, however, over time, a preventative health care approach will decrease health related anxieties, protect your financial future, and increase your wellness and longevity for years to come.

3661,8,"2017-06-07 15:18:08","2017-06-07 15:18:08","Knowing the symptoms of stress is vitally important to preventive health, and learning good stress management skills is one of the hallmarks of a good preventative health care plan. While a little stress in life is normal, and can actually boost motivation and concentration, chronic stress contributes to lowered immune system function, addictive behaviors, and many chronic and degenerative illnesses. In our modern era, we are confronted with ongoing societal and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/preventing-workplace-stress/\">workplace stress</a> in ways we are not biologically designed to cope with. The fight or flight response is meant to be intense, brief, and then regulated as the body returns to homeostasis, but we are often exposed to a near constant stream of potential stressors that take their toll on our physical and mental health over time. Here are some of the top signs that stress is negatively impacting your health and well-being, and what you can do about it.
<ol>
 	<li>Recurring headaches</li>
 	<li>Body aches and muscle pain</li>
 	<li>Sleep disturbances</li>
 	<li>Stomach and digestive upset</li>
 	<li>Chronic fatigue</li>
 	<li>Anxiety</li>
 	<li>Mood disturbances: depression, anger, and / or irritability</li>
 	<li>Overeating or undereating</li>
 	<li>Social withdrawal</li>
 	<li>Addictive behaviors and substance abuse</li>
</ol>
Managing stress well takes a two-pronged approach: we do what we can to structure our lives in such a way that we prevent stress where we can, and when confronted with stress we cannot control, we can develop skills that help ourselves process events in healthier ways. We are aiming to minimize the stress burden on our minds and bodies as much as possible. Here are five <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/manage_your_stress_with_these_techniques/\">stress management techniques</a> that will help:
<ol>
 	<li><strong> Deep Breathing</strong></li>
</ol>
Diaphragmatic breathing helps to quickly reset your parasympathetic nervous system (the stress regulating part of your nervous system) after stress induced fight or flight mode. When we are under stress our breathing tends to be tight, shallow, and centered in the chest. By taking some conscious deep breaths from your diaphragm for a few minutes, you will reduce your stress hormone (cortisol) levels, and help your body regulate back to a state of calm.
<ol start=\"2\">
 	<li><strong> Meditation</strong></li>
</ol>
Meditation is one of the most efficient stress reduction techniques we know of. Regular <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/mindfulness-meditation-practice-changes-the-brain\">mindfulness meditation</a> reduces the amount of neurons in the amygdala, which is the area of the brain associated with fear, stress and anxiety. A regular meditation practice helps train you to release negative thought patterns while changing the brain on a structural level as well.
<ol start=\"3\">
 	<li><strong> Exercise</strong></li>
</ol>
Regular exercise releases endorphins which help you relax and feel good, it boosts your mood, and increases feelings of calm while lowering symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression. Regular exercise also improves sleep, which is key to good <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/exercise-and-stress/art-20044469\">stress management</a>.
<ol start=\"4\">
 	<li><strong> Gratitude</strong></li>
</ol>
Practicing <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/in-praise-of-gratitude\">gratitude</a> is shown to increase optimism and reduce the harmful effects of stress. A simple gratitude list or journal that you work with each day is a powerful way to boost your resilience against stress and hardship. In the face of life’s challenges, it is helpful to remember the things in our lives that are good, however simple they may be. Try this: each night before bed, jot down five to ten things you feel grateful for in your life. Take the time to feel, not just think about, why you are grateful for this person or aspect of your life. With time and practice the benefits to your mood and stress resilience will increase.
<ol start=\"5\">
 	<li><strong> Social Support</strong></li>
</ol>
Social support is key to good mental and emotional health. Being able to talk to a trusted friend or advisor about our troubles helps us feel connected to others, and reduces feelings of isolation. People with higher levels of social support report lower levels of depression and anxiety, higher self-esteem and are better able to cope with stress. Many people need more <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/emotional-support.aspx\">emotional support</a> than they have access to, so it may be necessary to consciously work to build a better support network in your life. Reach out to a colleague or friend, take a new class where you will meet others with common interests, or seek professional therapy when needed. Community support groups can also be an invaluable resource for connecting with others for specific problems such as illness, addiction recovery, or other stress related life events.

In sum, the demands placed on us in life can be overwhelming at times, but with practice we can develop greater stress resilience and problem solving skills. While we cannot avoid all the stressors that we encounter, we can develop healthier responses for coping with life’s inevitable hardships. Not only will skillful stress management increase your mental and emotional health, it is part of an overall preventative care lifestyle that will help you avoid many chronic and degenerative illnesses, and increase your longevity and quality of life for years to come.

3677,8,"2017-06-07 15:20:07","2017-06-07 15:20:07","June is Men's Health Month. Many men take their health for granted until something happens that requires a trip to the doctor. According to <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/menshealth.html\">MedlinePlus</a>, compared to women, men are more likely to engage in unhealthy and risky behaviors including smoking, drinking, and delaying regular check–ups and medical care. <a href=\"http://www.menshealthmonth.org/\">Men’s Health Month</a> is celebrated each year to encourage men to make their health a priority in order to lead longer, healthier lives.
<h3>Promoting Health</h3>
To make health a priority, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/men/nmhw/\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> recommends that men take the following important steps:
<ul>
 	<li>Get enough sleep</li>
 	<li>Do not smoke</li>
 	<li>Engage in regular physical activity</li>
 	<li>Consume a healthy diet</li>
 	<li>Manage Stress</li>
 	<li>Receive regular checkups and preventive screenings</li>
</ul>
<h3>Get Enough Sleep</h3>
Adequate sleep is vital to a man’s health and well-being. According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/sleep/\">CDC</a>, inadequate sleep is associated with numerous chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression. Poor sleep habits can cause many important aspects of life to suffer including work performance, relationships, productivity, and safety. Sleep needs are largely individual, and some men can thrive with less sleep than others; however, according to the <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/howmuch.html\">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHBLI)</a>, most adults need approximately seven to eight hours of sleep each night.
<h3>Do Not Smoke</h3>
The most important step that men can take to protect their health is to never start smoking. For men who already smoke, the healthiest thing to do is to stop smoking. According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/#children\">CDC</a>, cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable and premature death in the United States, resulting in an estimated 480,000 deaths each year. According to <a href=\"http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/50-years-of-progress/full-report.pdf\">the U.S. Surgeon General</a>, \"10 times as many U.S. citizens have died prematurely from cigarette smoking than have died in all the wars fought by the United States during its history. Study after study has confirmed the magnitude of the harm caused to the human body by exposure to toxicants and carcinogens found in tobacco smoke.\" Smoking negatively affects nearly every organ in the body and impacts a man’s overall health tremendously. For smokers who want to quit, there is a considerable amount of information and support available.
<h3>Engage in Regular Physical Activity</h3>
The <a href=\"http://acsm.org/about-acsm/media-room/news-releases/2011/08/01/acsm-issues-new-recommendations-on-quantity-and-quality-of-exercise\">American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/paguide.pdf\">Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/PhysicalActivity/FitnessBasics/American-Heart-Association-Recommendations-for-Physical-Activity-in-Adults_UCM_307976_Article.jsp\">American Heart Association (AHA)</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/healthy/eathealthygetactive/acsguidelinesonnutritionphysicalactivityforcancerprevention/acs-guidelines-on-nutrition-and-physical-activity-for-cancer-prevention-summary\">American Cancer Society (ACS)</a> all agree that most adults should engage in a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate–intensity exercise each week. The performance of regular physical activity offers many benefits including weight management, stress relief, an improved sense of well-being, a reduction in the risk of many diseases and conditions, improvement in the overall quality of one’s life, and the maintenance of functional independence among older adults. According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/health/index.html?s_cid=cs_284\">CDC</a>, \"Only a few lifestyle choices have as large an impact on your health as physical activity. People who are physically active for about 7 hours a week have a 40 percent lower risk of dying early than those who are active for less than 30 minutes a week.\" The <a href=\"http://acsm.org/about-acsm/media-room/news-releases/2011/08/01/acsm-issues-new-recommendations-on-quantity-and-quality-of-exercise\">ACSM</a> concurs, reporting that most causes of death are delayed by regular performance of physical activity.
<h3>Consume a Healthy Diet</h3>
A healthy eating pattern is fundamental to the maintenance of good health and wellbeing. According to the <a href=\"http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/dietaryguidelines2010.pdf\"><i>Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010</i></a>, a diet that is considered to be healthy is one that limits the intake of salt, saturated fats, added sugars and sweeteners, solid fats, and refined grains. A healthy diet also emphasizes the consumption of plant–based foods that are low in calorie density and high in nutrient density (i.e., fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables, intact whole grains, and legumes) as well as lean proteins. Healthy eating that focuses on these nutrient–dense foods can help to control weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. The specific amounts of each food group that a man should consume will depend upon his age and physical activity level, but the overall recommendation is for men to follow the <a href=\"http://www.choosemyplate.gov/about.html\">MyPlate</a> recommendations.
<h3>Manage Stress</h3>
According to the latest <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2014/stress-report.pdf\">Stress in America</a> survey, the average stress level in men has decreased since 2007 (4.5 on a 10–point scale in 2014 versus 6.0 in 2007). However, this level remains significantly higher than the 3.7 stress rating considered to be healthy. While women report higher stress levels than men, men are less likely than women to engage in an activity to help relieve or manage stress. Research has shown that high levels of stress can exacerbate existing illnesses and contribute to the development of conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, depression, and obesity. Because stress can have such a negative impact on a man’s health, the importance of stress management cannot be overstated. Everyone experiences stress differently, and there is no single method for managing or reducing stress that will work for everyone or in every situation. However, men can manage stress by learning to identify their stressors and then find ways to cope with and reduce their exposure to these stressors. Often, a combination of stress management techniques works best.
<h3>Other Lifestyle Choices</h3>
There are other important choices men can make each day that will lead to a safer, healthier life and that will protect them from disease and disability:

<b>Alcohol Consumption</b>: According to the <a href=\"http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/DietaryGuidelines2010.pdf\"><i>Dietary Guidelines</i></a>, the moderate consumption of alcohol is safe and even beneficial for most men, while the excessive consumption of alcohol has no benefits whatsoever and can be damaging. Moderate alcohol consumption is defined by the Guidelines as the consumption of no more than two alcoholic drinks per day for men. Men who consume excessive amounts of alcohol can suffer both short– and long–term negative effects. According to the <a href=\"http://www.ncadd.org/index.php/learn-about-alcohol/faqsfacts\">National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD) </a>, excessive alcohol consumption can negatively impact a man’s finances, emotional stability, and relationships with friends, family, and co–workers, and can also lead to a variety of health problems including neurological problems; cardiovascular problems; psychiatric or psychological problems; unintentional injuries; increased risk of liver, mouth, throat, larynx, esophagus, gastrointestinal, and colorectal cancers; liver diseases; and gastrointestinal problems. Any man who suspects he may have an alcohol use disorder should talk to a healthcare professional familiar with his circumstances to help determine whether or not a problem exists and to develop a treatment plan if a disorder does exist.

<b>Safety Habits</b>: Some important everyday safety precautions include wearing a seat-belt whenever traveling in a motor vehicle, wearing a helmet when on a motorcycle or bicycle, wearing sunscreen, practicing safe sex, and following a healthcare professional’s advice for managing chronic conditions.
<h3>Receive Regular Checkups and Preventive Screenings</h3>
Preventive medical screenings and exams are conducted to establish a physical health baseline. While there are general screening guidelines, it is important for all men to develop a partnership with a knowledgeable healthcare provider who can personalize screening recommendations according to each man’s unique needs. General screening guidelines are as follows:

<b>Blood pressure</b>: The <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/blood-pressure-in-adults-hypertension-screening\">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSF)</a> recommends that, beginning at age 18, men with normal blood pressure (lower than 120/80 millimeters of mercury [mmHg]) have their blood pressure checked at least once every two years; men with blood pressure between 120/80 and 139/89 should have their blood pressure checked annually. \"High\" blood pressure (HBP) is classified as 140/90 or higher, and men with HBP should consult with a physician for the appropriate screening schedule.

<b>Cholesterol</b>: According to the <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/public/heart/wyntk.pdf\">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)</a>, adults aged 20 and older should have their cholesterol tested at least once every five years. Adults who have risk factors such as diabetes, a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, and/or a history of heart disease, tobacco use, or high blood pressure should be tested more often. Optimal cholesterol levels are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li><i>Total cholesterol</i>: lower than 200 mg/DL</li>
 	<li><i>LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol</i>: lower than 100 mg/DL</li>
 	<li><i>HDL or \"good\" cholesterol</i>: higher than 60 mg/DL</li>
 	<li><i>Triglyceride levels</i>: less than 150 mg/DL</li>
</ul>
<b>Diabetes</b>: According to <a href=\"http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/37/Supplement_1/S14.full#sec-26\"><i>Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes—2014</i></a>, men without risk factors should be tested for diabetes at age 45 with repeated testing at least every 3 years if results are normal. The <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/type-2/\">American Diabetes Association (ADA)</a> also recommends that men who are overweight (a BMI greater than 25) and have additional risk factors be screened for diabetes regardless of age, while the <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsdiab.htm\">USPSTF</a> recommends screening for men whose blood pressure is higher than 135/80.

<b>Depression</b>: Depression is a serious mental health condition that can last for weeks, months, or even years and greatly impact a man’s daily functioning. According to the <a href=\"http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/men-and-depression/index.shtml\">National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)</a>, men often experience depression differently than women. Men may be more likely to feel very tired and irritable, lose interest in their work, family, or hobbies, and be more likely to have difficulty sleeping. Additionally, while women who suffer from depression are more likely to attempt suicide, men are more likely to die by suicide. Men who experience symptoms of depression should discuss screening options with a healthcare professional.

<b>Prostate Cancer</b>: There are two tests that can be used for the early detection of prostate cancer:
<ul>
 	<li><i>Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)</i>: According to the <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Detection/PSA\">National Cancer Institute (NCI)</a>, the PSA test is a blood test that measures the level of prostate–specific antigen (a protein produced by the prostate) in the blood. The level of PSA in the blood can be higher in men who have prostate cancer, though the PSA level may also be elevated due to other conditions.</li>
 	<li><i>Digital Rectal Exam (DRE)</i>: A doctor or nurse will insert a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to feel the prostate, estimate its size, and to feel for lumps or other abnormalities.</li>
</ul>
If the results of the PSA or DRE are abnormal, additional testing will be necessary to definitively diagnose prostate cancer. Based upon the findings of its medical advisory board, EHE considers PSA screening in all men aged 40 and over. Absolute PSA levels are measured, as is the rate of change across different measurements. EHE discusses all potential advantages and shortcomings of the PSA test with patients prior to screening.

<b>Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (HPV4) Vaccine</b>: According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hpv.html\">CDC</a>, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine use of HPV4 among males who are 11 or 12 years of age, though boys as young as 9 may be immunized. Vaccination with HPV4 is also recommended for males between the ages of 13 and 21 who were never vaccinated previously or who did not complete the 3–dose series. Men aged 22 through 26 years may also be vaccinated.

<b>Hepatitis A Vaccine</b>: According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/hep-a.html#who\">CDC</a>, this vaccination is especially important for men who: have sex with men; use street drugs; suffer from chronic liver disease; are being treated with clotting factor concentrates; work with hepatitis A–infected primates or who work with hepatitis A in research laboratories; or are in a household planning to adopt a child, or care for a newly–arriving adopted child from a country where hepatitis A is common. Two doses of the vaccine given at least six months apart are needed for lasting protection.

<b>Hepatitis B Vaccine</b>: According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/hep-b.html\">CDC</a>, this vaccination is especially important for men who: are sex partners of people who are Hepatitis B–positive; are infected with HIV; have had multiple sex partners; have sex with men; are current or recent street drug users; are household contacts of people who are hepatitis B–positive; are residents and staff of facilities for the developmentally disabled; have chronic liver or kidney disease or who are on dialysis; are under age 60 with diabetes; travel to countries where hepatitis B is common; and work in occupations that expose them to human blood or other body fluids.

<b>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) </b>: According to the <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/hiv/hivfinalrs.htm\">USPSTF</a>, all men aged 13 to 64 should be tested at least once for HIV. Additionally, annual screening for HIV is recommended for men who have had unprotected sex with multiple partners; have used injected drugs or have had sex partners who have used injected drugs; have paid for sex or had sex partners who have paid for sex; have past or current sex partners who are infected with HIV; or are being treated for sexually–transmitted diseases. The frequency with which an individual is tested will depend on his activities and sexual contacts.

<b>Sexually–Transmitted Diseases</b>: The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/screeningreccs.htm\">CDC</a> recommends that all men who have sex with men be screened at least once a year for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Additionally, all men who have sex with men and who have multiple or anonymous partners should be screened more frequently.

<b>Colorectal Cancer</b>: While the <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/cancer/colonandrectumcancer/detailedguide/index\">ACS</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspscolo.htm\">USPSTF</a> recommend screening beginning at age 50, EHE International’s Medical Advisory Board recommends a screening (colonoscopy) beginning at age 40 and repeated every 5 to 10 years or as otherwise recommended by a gastroenterologist. The Board’s findings are based on extensive research which indicates that the incidence of polyps is as common between the ages of 40 and 49 as it is between the ages of 50 and 79. EHE also recommends that men with a family history or other risk factors consult a physician about beginning screenings at a younger age and/or being screened more frequently.

<b>Vascular Screening</b>: EHE International strongly recommends vascular screening for all men over the age of 50 as well as men who have certain risk factors. Screening forms the first line of defense against vascular disease. Detection of disease while an individual is still asymptomatic allows for early disease management and the avoidance of potentially–devastating health events. EHE recommends the following vascular screening exams:
<ul>
 	<li><i>Ultrasound study of the abdominal aorta</i>: This screening exam looks for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), which are weaknesses or bulges in the wall of the abdominal aorta.</li>
 	<li><i>Ultrasound study of the carotid arteries</i>: This screening exam looks for atherosclerosis of the <i>carotid arteries</i>, the two large blood vessels in the neck that supply oxygen–rich blood to the brain.</li>
 	<li><i>Ankle–brachial index (ABI) using Doppler blood pressure measurement</i>: This screening exam is performed using a blood pressure cuff and a pencil–shaped ultrasound device called a \"Doppler.\" The test is used to check for peripheral artery disease (PAD). The ABI test can also be used to follow the improvement or worsening of leg circulation over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
Many factors affect your health. Although some factors cannot be controlled such as one’s genetic makeup or age, there are important preventive steps that can be taken in order to live a longer, healthier life. Having regular physical exams, getting appropriate screenings throughout one’s lifespan, and leading a healthy lifestyle are three of the most important preventive measures that can be controlled. This year, celebrate Men’s Health Month by encouraging the men in your life to make their health a priority and to follow these simple steps for a longer, healthier, and happier life.

If you have expired medications, front steps that need repairing, or safety lights due for replacing, now is the time to take action and finish up those projects. Injuries are the leading cause of death for people age 1 to 44, and they are the leading cause of disability across all age groups. There are many things you can do to stay safe and reduce risks to you and your family; it is also important to report safety hazards in your workplace and communities, and to encourage others to do the same.

<strong>What is the Purpose of National Safety Month?</strong>

Each week of National Safety Month is dedicated to raising awareness about a different potential safety risk. Topics for discussion include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Medication Safety and Prescription Painkiller Abuse. </strong>Medications are required to manage some illnesses and health conditions, and are generally safe when prescribed and used correctly. That said, there are potential risks with any drug, including side effects; addiction to prescription painkillers is a risk with certain narcotic, and synthetic or semi-synthetic opiates, though other types of prescription drugs can be addictive as well. <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prescription-drug-abuse/basics/symptoms/con-20032471\">Learn to recognize the signs of prescription drug abuse</a>, and always talk to your doctor about potential risks and side effects before embarking on a new drug regimen.</li>
 	<li><strong>Transportation Safety Tips. </strong>General safety tips for drivers include obeying all traffic laws, abiding by traffic lights, and speed limits. Slow down, stay alert and be ready to stop. Be aware of crosswalks, school bus flashing lights, and residential neighborhoods where children live and play. <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/what_is_distracted_driving/\">Avoid distractions when behind the wheel</a>, and be aware of the dangers of texting while driving: there is a 1 in 4 chance that a motor vehicle accident will involve a cell phone, so put the phone away when operating a vehicle.</li>
 	<li><strong>First Aid and Preparedness. </strong><a href=\"http://www.redcross.org/get-help/prepare-for-emergencies/be-red-cross-ready/get-a-kit\">Preparedness means having supplies on hand</a>, and readily transportable, that will help you in the event of an accident or disaster. Stored gallons of water, a first-aid kit, non-perishable foods, flashlights, and extra batteries are all items (among others) you will want included in your kit. Also consider taking a <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/first-aid\">first-aid and CPR course</a> that will train you to intervene in the case of certain injuries and / or life-threatening emergencies.</li>
 	<li><strong>Preventing Slips and Falls. </strong>Tips for avoiding injuries through falls, especially at home, include wearing adequate footwear, as opposed to stocking feet or being barefoot. Athletic shoes decrease our risk of falls and slips, particularly as we age. Use non-skid rugs in the home, and be sure to store items you use frequently in easy-to-reach places. As always, be sure to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/lower_your_risk_of_falling_with_balance_training/\">exercise: a conditioned body has better strength and balance</a>, and is more resilient against injury in the case of a fall. Repair broken and damaged steps and stairways, use the handrails, and take deliberate, mindful steps as you go about your day.</li>
 	<li><strong>Workplace Safety. </strong>Creating a <a href=\"http://www.nsc.org/learn/Pages/safety-at-work.aspx\">safety culture in the workplace</a> includes everything from identifying potential environmental safety hazards, to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/creating_a_culture_of_health/\">health forums and preventative care and wellness programs</a>. Employers who express care towards the health and safety of their employees see improved morale and productivity, lower costs, and fewer workplace injuries and absenteeism.</li>
</ul>
Everyone can get involved in safety education for National Safety Month, and beyond. Applying our knowledge and sharing what we learn helps spread awareness within our communities and workplaces. Together we can share information about how we can all better protect ourselves, friends, and families from preventable accidents and injuries.

3702,8,"2017-06-21 14:03:48","2017-06-21 14:03:48","Summer is the perfect time to make good on your fitness goals, and adding outdoor sports to your workout regimen is a great way to increase exercise and fun. Outdoor sports are the perfect addition to your weekly yoga class or time at the gym, and fresh air and sunshine do wonders for your health and your mood. Whether you prefer the beach, a forest hike, or a river rafting trip, there are many diverse and amazing ways for you to break up your routine and get outside this summer. Here is our top ten list of <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/join-adult-recreational-sports-team/\">sports to get you out of the house, active, and having a great time this year</a>.
<ol>
 	<li>One of the best forms of exercise, and a great way to get active in the water, outdoor swimming is the perfect summer activity. And <a href=\"http://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/exercise/arthritis-friendly/lap-swimming.php\">if you have arthritis or problems with your joints, swimming is also an excellent, no impact workout</a>.</li>
 	<li>Tennis can be played year round if you have access to an indoor court, but a match outside in the fresh air is even better, so grab a buddy, and enjoy some friendly competition.</li>
 	<li>Whether you prefer to ride alone, or want to coordinate some family or friend time, biking in the warmer months is a great way to get some exercise outside; and if you can manage a <a href=\"http://www.active.com/cycling/articles/bike-commuting-tips\">biking commute</a> to work when the weather allows, even better.</li>
 	<li><strong>Frisbee Golf. </strong>Local parks often have Frisbee golf courses set up, so all you need to do is grab your friends and your Frisbees, and enjoy some time at the park.</li>
 	<li>If you have an adventurous streak and love the outdoors, kayaking is an exhilarating form of summer exercise. There is nothing like getting active in the water in a gorgeous, natural setting. If you are a <a href=\"https://mpora.com/kayaking/kayaking-beginners-essential-tips#HBL8gkLDicHbbgxc.97\">first-time kayaker</a>, take a lesson or get an experienced guide or friend to go with you, and show you the ins and outs of navigating the rapids.</li>
 	<li>Check in with your local archery club or organization, and see what outdoor events and classes are available throughout the warmer months.</li>
 	<li><strong>Beach volleyball. </strong>If you enjoy focused competition and teamwork, beach volleyball is for you. Many beaches have nets set up for use; just grab your friends, your sunscreen, and some balls, and enjoy a gorgeous day in the sun.</li>
 	<li><strong>Run a 5k. </strong>A 5k is great for both experienced runners and <a href=\"http://www.active.com/running/articles/9-race-day-tips-for-your-first-5k\">newbies</a>. If you are new to running you’ll need to start training in the spring to build strength, cardiovascular fitness, and endurance. Usually you will register in advance, so you have time to prepare in the months leading up to your race.</li>
 	<li>Basketball is one of the best full body workouts around, and it’s perfect for the summer months when the days are longer, so it’s easy to grab some friends and head to the park or court after work. Basketball will give you great overall muscle tone, while building cardiovascular strength and endurance.</li>
 	<li>Hiking gets you into nature while building muscle and cardiovascular strength. There are trails for just about every ability level, so if you like a challenge, go for steeper and rockier climbs, or find a nearby trail that fits your needs. Remember to keep a good pace to keep your heart rate up, and don’t forget to bring along a pack with your essentials: water, snacks, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/wearable_tech/\">wearable device</a>, and sunscreen.</li>
</ol>
There is no better time of year to combine your commitment to exercise with sheer fun. No matter your fitness level, or your range of athletic prowess, there is an outdoor activity for you. Even a simple run or <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/walking-tours/\">brisk walk</a> each day will get you up, moving and active, and enjoying some fresh air and sun this summer.

3708,8,"2017-06-21 13:58:35","2017-06-21 13:58:35","Many people find the work-life balance challenging to navigate. In addition to heavy workloads we have families, friends, self-care, and personal interests to attend to, all of which are important to our overall happiness and well-being. Often, we are met with overwhelming demands in multiple areas of our lives, and it can be difficult to develop a strategy for balancing the various responsibilities we face. Once we are chronically overloaded our stress hormone levels spike, productivity and relationships suffer, and we become more vulnerable to lowered immunity and illness. With some structure and a bit of strategy, however, we can learn to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/manage_your_stress_with_these_techniques/\">manage stress</a>, and achieve better balance and quality of life.

<strong>Strategies for Work</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Boundaries: </strong>If you are in the habit of taking on every responsibility and project that comes your way it might be time to learn the art of saying no. Be realistic about how much you can take on at a given time. Depending on your profession, you may have more or less control over your workload, but wherever you do have a say, you can learn to draw a line when you need to. Learn to say no.</li>
 	<li><strong>Work from Home: </strong>Again, this is profession specific, but whenever possible ask for flexibility with your schedule. Even telecommuting one day a week from home can help alleviate stress. Many companies are becoming savvy to the importance of work / life balance, and are adopting policies to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/preventing-workplace-stress/\">prevent workplace stress</a>, so find out what your options are.</li>
 	<li><strong>Take Breaks: </strong>Breaks are necessary throughout the day, and you are entitled to take a pause when needed. When you start to feel fatigued, frustrated, or overwhelmed, get up from your desk, take a walk, get some fresh air, and engage some <a href=\"https://www.stress.org/take-a-deep-breath/\">deep breathing</a> to reset. Apps like <a href=\"http://www.accupedo.com/\">Accupedo</a> can motivate you to track your daily activity and stay active.</li>
 	<li><strong>Set Reasonable Expectations: </strong>Perfectionism in work and in life is linked to chronic stress and illness, so go a little easy on yourself. Bring your best to what you do, but understand that mistakes, or a less than perfect job performance at times, are normal. Remember that performance tends to suffer when we are pushed past capacity, so delegate where and when you can, and ask for help when you need it.</li>
 	<li><strong>Draft a Daily To-Do List: </strong>Set manageable goals each day and keep track of them. By drawing up a daily list of priorities and tasks to achieve, and staying on top of them as you complete them one by one, you will feel a sense of mastery over your workload which reduces stress and the feeling of being overwhelmed.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Strategies for Home</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Practice Self-Care: </strong>Identify what you need to feel your best, be healthy, and regulate when you are stressed and upset. Self-care is for you: the more you are able to reset your energy and cope with stressors, the more you have to give to your relationships and other areas of your life. Exercise, meditation, journaling, listening to music, time alone, walks in nature, avoiding upsetting media during certain times, pursuing hobbies or personal interests, are all examples of ways to practice self-care. Think about the things you enjoy that recharge and help you feel renewed and refreshed on an ongoing basis. Good self-care is something you can learn to weave throughout your daily and weekly schedule. Self-care also makes you more stress resilient overall.</li>
 	<li><strong>Delegate:</strong> Take steps to ensure that responsibilities at home are fairly distributed among household members so that no one person is carrying the majority of the weight. Draw up chore charts and lists, or clearly discuss who will be responsible for what on a daily and / or weekly basis.</li>
 	<li><strong>More Boundaries:</strong> Carve out distraction free time with loved ones. Maybe you decide that work brought home is only done in a designated area (like an office) at set times, but devices and work at the dinner table are off limits. Maybe you commit to dinner as a couple / family four nights a week while leaving the other three open for other work and social commitments. Decide what works for you based on the needs of your household.</li>
 	<li><strong>Eat Well: </strong>Do your best to keep your diet based on whole, fresh, and natural foods, and take the time to eat in a mindful way. Prepare your own meals as much as possible, and avoid stressful conversation at meal times.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cultivate Friendships: </strong><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195151/\">Social support</a> is key to a good work / life balance. Supportive friendships reduce stress, isolation, and strengthen the immune system. Have at least one or two people you can trust and confide in; social support is good for your mental and emotional health, and makes you more stress resilient in all areas of your life.</li>
</ul>
Maybe you have a good balance in some areas of your life, but need to shore up others; perhaps you are starting from scratch. Begin from where you are and know that it is possible to improve no matter how daunting the process may seem. One powerful way to strengthen your work / life balance is to release time wasting activities and relationships. If someone or something is more of an energy and time drain than an asset, assess if you can afford the investment of your precious time. Figure out what your priorities are and make them your main focus.

What is <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/what_is_distracted_driving/\">distracted driving</a>, and what are the risks? According to the <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)</a>, distracted driving is any activity that takes our attention from the road and the task of driving. Any activity we engage in that diverts our focus from the road increases our risk of accidents and puts us and any passengers we may be transporting at risk. The NHTSA estimates that 10 percent of all fatal crashes, and 17 percent of all accidents that cause injuries, are due to distracted driving; nearly 1 in 5 of all crashes that result in injury are caused by some form of distracted driving. A list of what is considered distracted driving would include:
<ul>
 	<li>Texting, and using a cell or Smartphone</li>
 	<li>Eating and drinking</li>
 	<li>Smoking</li>
 	<li>Grooming, applying makeup, etc.</li>
 	<li>Disciplining children</li>
 	<li>Reading, including maps</li>
 	<li>Watching a video</li>
 	<li>Adjusting temperature controls or a GPS navigational system</li>
 	<li>Adjusting the radio or MP3 player</li>
</ul>
<strong>What are the Facts, and How Serious are the Risks?</strong>

<strong> </strong>Research conducted at the University of Utah shows that using a cell or Smartphone while driving quadruples your risk of an accident: about equivalent to the risk of driving while drunk. That risk doubles, yet again, if you are texting. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration reports that you are 23 times more likely to experience a car accident when texting while driving than if you did not engage in that distraction. <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/driver_electronic_device_use_in_2015_0.pdf\">According to the NHTSA</a>, more than 3,331 people were killed, and 387,000 injured, in motor vehicle accidents related to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/\">distracted driving</a> in 2015 alone.

<strong>Three Types of Distractions</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Manual distractions occur when you remove your hands from the wheel for any length of time while driving. Reaching for a beverage or adjusting the radio station are examples of manual distractions.</li>
 	<li>Visual distractions are those where you remove your focus from the road. If you were to glance down at an incoming message on your phone, for instance, that would be an example of a visual distraction.</li>
 	<li>A cognitive distraction occurs when your mind, your focus, wanders from paying attention to the road. When you are going over your to-do list for the day, or revisiting a quarrel with your spouse in your mind, these would be examples of cognitive distractions.</li>
</ul>
Texting is especially dangerous while driving because it involves the three types of distraction combined: manual, visual, and cognitive. Sending or receiving a text message distracts a driver for approximately 5 full seconds each time; at highway speeds, this equates to a distance of about 300 feet per text.

<strong>In Sum</strong>

<a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2009/11/16/teens-and-distracted-driving/\">Research shows that teens are at the greatest risk for distracted driving</a>. This may be due to inexperience, as younger drivers may be more prone to overestimating their ability to multitask. In 2009, the NHTSA reported that 16 percent of teen drivers killed in a car crash were distracted. Most adults are aware that distractions while driving, particularly texting or sending emails, are dangerous, yet distracted drivers continue to cause a minimum of 3100 deaths, and 400,000 injuries each year in the United States alone. The statistics show us that distracted driving is a problem across all age groups, and while adults may be more likely to understand the risks involved, risk taking behavior while driving still occurs. Distracted driving is as dangerous, at least, as drunk driving, but we have yet to socially condemn these behaviors in the same way. We all have a responsibility to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/national-safety-month/\">commit to safety and driving distraction free</a>, and to hold each other accountable to do the same.

3755,8,"2017-07-14 14:35:19","2017-07-14 14:35:19","<p class=\"Normal1\">Most of us know the importance of wearing sunscreen in the summer months to avoid sunburn and damage, but it really should be a year-round <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/skin_cancer_foundation/\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">preventive health measure</span></a>. Always wear sunscreen, no matter your skin color or tone. Sunscreen dates back to ancient Egypt, where rice bran extract and jasmine were used to help shield skin from the sun. Chemists invented the first commercial sunscreen in 1936, and it has been improved upon ever since. Modern sunscreens are water resistant, and are included in many cosmetics and beauty products, such as primers, foundations, serums, and creams.</p>
<strong>Why You Should Always Wear Sunscreen, Even on Cloudy Days</strong>

Up to 80 percent of the sun’s rays can pass through clouds, so if you assume it’s OK to forgo protection on an overcast day, think again. <a href=\"https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/sunscreen_for_skin_cancer_prevention/\">Sunscreen is an important preventive health care habit</a> that should be maintained all year, including the winter months. Snow can reflect up to 80 percent of ultraviolet (UV) rays, increasing your risk of exposure to sun damage. Also, the higher the altitude, the greater the UV exposure, so sunscreen is crucial for family ski vacations, too. When in doubt: always wear sunscreen!
<p class=\"Normal1\">Here are the <strong>top five reasons why applying sunscreen should be a daily habit year round</strong>:</p>

<ol>
 	<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">
<ol>
 	<li><em>It Protects Your Skin from UV Rays</em>: The depletion of the ozone layer has increased our risk of sun damage from harmful UV rays. Sunscreen blocks these rays, greatly reducing the likelihood of sunburn. Look for <a href=\"https://www.goddessgarden.com/product-category/sunscreen/everyday/\">products like those from Goddess Garden with an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of at least 15</a> (some doctors recommend nothing below 30), and use each and every day. For full body coverage you’ll want to apply about an ounce.</li>
 	<li><em>It Lowers Your Skin Cancer Risk</em>: <a href=\"http://www.skincancer.org/\">Skin cancer</a> is the most common form of cancer in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 71,943 people were diagnosed with melanomas of the skin in 2013, and 9,394 of these cases were fatal. By applying sunscreen each day, you cut your risk of contracting skin cancers in half.</li>
 	<li><em>It Prevents Premature Aging of the Skin</em>: Sun damage from UV rays causes photoaging of the skin, which is characterized by a thick, leathery look; discoloration; and a breakdown of collagen, which contributes to lines, sagging and wrinkles. Studies show that those below age 55 who apply sunscreen regularly have 24 percent less chance of developing these signs of aging than those who don’t.</li>
 	<li><em>It Helps Maintain an Even Skin Tone</em>: Sunscreen helps prevent discoloration and dark spots from sun damage, helping you maintain a smoother and more even skin tone.</li>
 	<li><em>Your Chances of Skin Cancer are Higher if Your Hair is Red</em>: Scientists used to think the reason for this increased risk was due to the fair skin tone of redheads. In 2013, however, researchers discovered the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MC1R\">MC1R gene mutation</a> which creates red hair and fair skin. This mutation also creates a cancer causing pathway which, when exposed to UV radiation, promotes a genetic propensity towards cancer.</li>
</ol>

3759,8,"2017-07-14 13:22:01","2017-07-14 13:22:01","Summertime usually means lots of barbecues - typically filled with hot dogs, greasy chips, and burgers doused in cheese and mayonnaise. We've created this salmon burgers recipe as the perfect alternative to the standard barbecue menu. The salmon is juicy, flavorful and accompanied by a garlicky, creamy sauce. You won't miss any of the classic treats once you try this salmon burgers recipe, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/becoming-secret-chef/\">a fun way to get some great nutrition</a>.

<strong>Eat Salmon Burgers for DHA and EHA Content</strong>

We often hear that we should be eating more fish, but few of us actually get the 2-3 weekly servings recommended. We love these salmon burgers because you can easily freeze the patties and pop them into a pan for a quick dinner. Eating salmon adds a healthy dose of protein, which is the building block of our muscles and hormones. It also helps keep us satiated for longer. The fish is full of micronutrients like B vitamins and potassium. Most importantly, <a href=\"https://authoritynutrition.com/11-benefits-of-salmon/\">salmon is an excellent source of Omega-3s</a>, which are typically under-consumed in the modern American diet.

The Omega-3s found in salmon (and other oily fishes) are called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). You've probably seen supplements with these two names advertised - and for good reason, as they contribute to many functions throughout our body. Cultures in which the cuisine features regular fish consumption tend to have significantly lower rates of heart disease and high blood pressure. EHA and DHA are also crucial for brain function - improving memory, preventing depression, and lowering the risk for Alzheimer's disease.

<strong>Choose Healthier Bread Products</strong>

Traditional wheat products like white flour and breadcrumbs can trigger weight gain, blood sugar issues and inflammation throughout the body. For this salmon burger recipe, we've replaced breadcrumbs with almond flour, which is made by grinding almonds into a powder. Almonds add heart-healthy fats and additional protein as well. We've also suggested choosing sprouted or gluten-free buns. Sprouted wheat is healthier than whole wheat because it is more digestible. All grains contain phytic acid, which protects the plant but also inhibits our ability to absorb the nutrients. Sprouted bread products are less processed, so they also retain more of their nutrients. If you want an even lighter option, these patties are just as delicious served in a lettuce wrap.

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

<em>Salmon burgers:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>1 lb fresh salmon</li>
 	<li>1 egg</li>
 	<li>1/4 cup almond flour</li>
 	<li>1/2 small yellow onion</li>
 	<li>1/2 jalapeño</li>
 	<li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
 	<li>1/2 lemon</li>
 	<li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
 	<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3869\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Salmon-Burgers-Ingredients-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Salmon-Burgers-Ingredients\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />

<em>Avocado sauce:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>5.3 ounces of Greek yogurt (a single serving cup)</li>
 	<li>1 avocado</li>
 	<li>1 lemon</li>
 	<li>1-2 cloves garlic</li>
 	<li>3-4 basil leaves</li>
 	<li>salt</li>
</ul>

<em>For serving:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>red onion</li>
 	<li>butter lettuce</li>
 	<li>sprouted or gluten free buns</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 1: </strong>Make sauce. Remove stems from basil. Remove skin and pit from the avocado. Juice lemon. Add all ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth. If the sauce is too thick, you can add water slowly to thin it out. Set sauce aside.

<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3871\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Salmon-Burgers-Avocado-Sauce-1024x769.jpg\" alt=\"Salmon-Burgers-Avocado-Sauce\" width=\"600\" height=\"451\" />

<strong>Step 2:</strong> Remove skin from the salmon and cut into smaller chunks. Peel the onion and cut in half, setting one half aside. Cut jalapeño in half lengthwise and remove seeds, setting one half aside. Add all burger ingredients to a food processor and pulse until fully minced and combined.

<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3872\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Salmon-Burgers-Blend-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Salmon-Burgers-Blend\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />

<strong>Step 3: </strong>Divide salmon mixture into four equal portions. Mold each portion into a burger patty. Heat one tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat in a non-stick pan. Cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.

<strong>Step 4:</strong> Serve salmon immediately with thick slices of red onion, your avocado sauce, and buns or butter lettuce to wrap.

Picnics are one of the season’s greatest pleasures, whether you’re celebrating the Fourth of July or Labor Day, or just spending a long, sunny day at the beach. Healthy picnic food can be delicious, too. When <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/pack-your-picnic-basket-like-a-pro.html\">planning what to pack</a> for your next al fresco dining adventure, think about forgoing the typical fried chicken, potato chips, and hot dogs in favor of healthier, fresh, whole food options.

Here are some ideas for healthy picnic food:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=\"http://www.nourishingmeals.com/2010/04/garlic-rosemary-white-bean-dip-on.html\"><strong>Garlic Rosemary White Bean Dip</strong></a> - This creamy dip is perfect for whole grain crackers, baguettes or sliced raw veggies, and is easy to prepare and transport. This is also a great spread for layering in a (whole grain) sandwich or wrap.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://draxe.com/recipe/fruit-kabob/\"><strong>Fresh Fruit Kabobs</strong></a> - Fruit kabobs are a fun, beautiful and healthy treat. Grab some skewers and layer up however you’d like: try a combination of strawberry, grape, melon and pineapple, or make your own with your favorite fruits.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"http://jeanetteshealthyliving.com/mango-avocado-black-bean-quinoa-salad/\"><strong>Mango Avocado Quinoa and Black Bean Salad</strong></a> - This salad is a gorgeous, protein-packed alternative to the heavy, mayonnaise-laden standbys, and is perfect as a side dish or a vegetarian main course.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/sriracha-rainbow-noodle-salad-recipe.html\"><strong>Sriracha Rainbow Noodle Salad</strong></a> - Beautiful, colorful and delicious, this noodle salad is another amazing example of how to build a better, healthier picnic meal.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"http://www.nourishingmeals.com/2017/06/garlic-herb-turkey-burgers.html\"><strong>Garlic Herb Turkey Burgers</strong></a> - Made with organic turkey and fresh garlic and herbs, this burger is an excellent grilling option.

 	<li><a href=\"http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/19805/seasonal/summer/drinks/\"><strong>Better Beverages</strong></a> – You’ll definitely want to hydrate with a <a href=\"http://www.tervis.com/water-bottle\">quality water bottle like the ones from Tervis</a>, but what other drinks should you bring? Try to ditch the sodas (even diet versions); processed sugars and artificial sweeteners should be limited as much as possible. Instead, fill your cooler with pure filtered water, unsweetened ice tea, and <a href=\"https://elanaspantry.com/strawberry-lemonade/\">lemonade sweetened with a little stevia</a> or raw honey.</li>
</ul>
<strong>More Healthy Picnic Food Ideas</strong>

Pack your picnic basket with fresh hummus and whole grain pita, a veggie tray with a healthy dip, fresh berries, nectarines, and watermelon. Chopped vegetable salads you prepare early (without the lettuces) will taste even better the following day and are perfect for picnics. Lightly marinated grilled vegetables are wonderful as a side dish.

As you continue to explore healthier, more plant-focused options, try to find <a href=\"https://greatist.com/eat/best-food-blogs-2016\">whole foods bloggers</a> and experiment with their recipes. We all have emotional attachments to less-than-ideal meals and snacks, especially those we grew up with. The transition to healthy eating can seem daunting at first. But whole, natural foods can be every bit as satisfying and flavorful, while providing incredible nutritional advantages compared to overly processed, industrially produced foods. As you learn how to make <a href=\"https://greatist.com/health/83-healthy-recipe-substitutions\">healthier substitutions for your old favorites</a>, you will feel and look better. And there’s no better way to start than by packing healthy picnic food on a beautiful day.

3887,8,"2017-07-20 20:42:08","2017-07-20 20:42:08","Everyone knows how important it is to protect yourself from the sun in order <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/skin_cancer_foundation/\">to prevent skin cancer</a>. But are there harmful ingredients in sunscreen? In recent years, there’s been <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/shining-light-on-great-sunscreen-debate/\">a lot of debate</a> about whether certain chemicals in commercial sunscreens are safe. Health and wellness sites feature countless blog posts and articles warning against the dangers of allegedly harmful ingredients in sunscreen and questioning whether we actually need to use it. Let’s take a look at what the research says and separate what we know from what we don’t.

<strong>Know Your Sunscreen: First Things First</strong>

There are two different types of sunscreen: <em>scattering</em> (or blocking), and <em>absorbent</em>. Scattering sunscreens, which typically include zinc or titanium dioxide, block or deflect the ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun from permeating your skin. Absorbent sunscreens, with ingredients like oxybenzone, work by triggering a chemical reaction that absorbs the rays, thereby preventing damage to the skin. Some groups point to harmful ingredients in sunscreens of both kinds.

<strong>Potential Harmful Ingredients in Sunscreen: Nanoparticles </strong>

Some scientists have raised concerns about the zinc or titanium dioxide nanoparticles that provide a blocking sunscreen’s scattering action, which is needed to deflect UV rays. Those who are concerned believe these nanoparticles are small enough to permeate the skin and go all the way to the bloodstream.

A recent study showed that mice injected with titanium dioxide chemicals developed inflammation -- a marker for potential disease and cancer. But the relevance of this study is questionable, since sunscreen is obviously applied topically rather than injected. Toxicity concerns have not been raised with non-nanoparticle forms of zinc and titanium dioxide, but these sunscreens are not as widely available.

<strong>Potential Harmful Ingredients in Sunscreen: Oxybenzone</strong>

The most common commercial sunscreens contain chemical filters like oxybenzone, avobenzone, homosalate, octinoxate, octisalate, and octocrylene. In sufficiently high amounts, oxybenzone is thought to interact with the endocrine system and disrupt hormonal function. Worries about oxybenzone stem from a study showing reactions in rats that were given the chemical through their food. Researchers have since stated that the amount of oxybenzone exposure through topical use of sunscreen is not significant enough to cause problems in human beings.

The <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/\">Environmental Working Group</a> asserts that some chemical <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/sun-safety-sunscreen-and-sun-protection#1\">sunscreen</a> UV filters, like oxybenzone, have been shown to penetrate the skin’s barrier and mimic hormones, causing allergic reactions and other issues. The American Academy of Dermatology, however, continues to recommend sunscreens containing oxybenzone as safe.

<strong>The Retinyl Palmitate Problem</strong>

Retinyl palmitate, a form of vitamin A often found in sunscreens, has limited data showing it may be linked to the development of certain skin tumors and cancers. More research is needed, but the Environmental Working Group recommends sunscreens and cosmetics that do not contain this ingredient.

<strong>So Are There Harmful Ingredients in Sunscreen?</strong>

So are there harmful ingredients in sunscreen? In many ways, the jury is still out. But what's not debatable is the use of some type of sunscreen as an essential preventive health habit. Everyone agrees on this point, even those who have concerns about certain ingredients. If you are concerned about chemical exposure and want to avoid oxybenzone, opt for zinc and titanium dioxide forms of sunscreen, particularly the non-nano particle forms, as they are proven safe and effective. You can also easily avoid retinyl palmitate. While the debate rages as to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/23/health/sunscreen-consumer-guidelines/index.html\">which chemical sunscreens are the safest and most effective</a>, there’s no doubt it’s better to use sunscreen than not.

<strong>Final Points to Consider</strong>

Sunscreens need to be used correctly if they’re to be used at all as a preventive measure against sun damage and skin cancer. This means using products with a sufficiently high SPF value. Most experts recommend SPF 30 at an absolute minimum. Sunscreen should be reapplied throughout the day, particularly if exposed to sweat or water. It is also important to use broad spectrum sunscreens, which block the two types of ultraviolet rays: UVA and UVB, both of which are linked to melanoma and other <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/skin_cancer_foundation/\">skin cancers</a>. If you want to ensure you’re getting the safest possible product, you can check out the <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/executive-summary/\">Environmental Working Group’s 2017 Sunscreen Guide</a>. Also remember that for effective, full body coverage, you need to apply about an ounce.

3893,8,"2017-07-20 14:46:18","2017-07-20 14:46:18","Sun damaged skin becomes more of a problem as we age. Excessive exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays can cause changes to the skin collectively known as <a href=\"http://www.skincancer.org/healthy-lifestyle/anti-aging/what-is-photoaging\">photoaging</a>. The dermatological development is characterized by a coarse and dry skin appearance; other features include freckling, discoloration, a leathery look, and deep wrinkles. Sun damaged skin can happen to anyone, not just those who <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/skin_cancer_foundation/\">go tanning regularly</a> or work outdoors. The right course of action for managing the effects of photoaging depends on its severity, as well as factors such as your age and overall health, the specific type of damage sustained, and how well you tolerate certain therapies and treatments. You may also have an inclination toward the general type of treatment, whether you prefer natural options or a more standard medical approach.

Of course, aging cannot be avoided entirely. But good skin care, combined with <a href=\"http://www.eatingwell.com/nutrition_health/healthy_aging/healthy_aging_diet_guidelines\">a healthy diet and lifestyle</a>, will slow some of its physical impact and soften the effects of time and sun exposure. If you have sun damaged skin due to photoaging, you can improve its appearance and avoid further harm. Here are some options to prevent and reverse the effects of too much sun on your skin.

<strong>Natural Treatments for Sun Damaged Skin</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Aloe Vera</strong> - Aloe vera is one of the most effective natural remedies for sun damaged skin. It contains 150 trace elements and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, copper, zinc, selenium, potassium, iron, and amino acids. For best results, go directly to the source and cut open an aloe vera leaf, extracting the gel. Apply the gel directly to your skin, let it dry, and then rinse with cool water. Reapply several times per day to heal and soothe your skin.</li>
 	<li><strong>Honey</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609166/\">Honey is a natural antibiotic</a> and helps trap moisture to the skin. It also contains natural antioxidants, which are found in particularly high amounts in the darker varieties of honey. These antioxidants help to heal and neutralize free-radical damage to the skin from the sun, pollution, and stress. At-home skin treatments made with raw, dark honey will help to improve the tone, texture, and moisture content of your skin.</li>
 	<li><strong>Lemon Juice </strong>- Lemon juice contains natural alpha hydroxy and glycolic acids that gently exfoliate the skin to improve texture and uneven skin tone caused by sun damage. You can make a homemade toner by mixing one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice with a half cup of pure water. Apply to the skin with a cotton ball or pad, and let it dry for 30 to 60 minutes. You can then leave the preparation on your skin or rinse with cool water.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vitamin A </strong>- Eat foods rich in <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/the_13_essential_vitamins/\">vitamin A</a>, such as eggs, fish, and brightly colored vegetables, as part of a healthy overall diet featuring fresh, natural foods. Vitamin A is a natural antioxidant that promotes the healing and regeneration of sun damaged skin.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Medical Treatments for Sun Damaged Skin</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Prescription Retinoids</strong> - Retinoids help even skin tone, and increase the amount of collagen in your skin, facilitating a more youthful appearance. A doctor can prescribe a retinoid cream or serum, like Retin A, for a full-strength effect. You can also opt for the less potent, over-the-counter form of retinol.</li>
 	<li><strong>Microdermabrasion</strong> - Microdermabrasion gently sands and exfoliates the skin with small crystals, grains, or diamond tips. The process removes the outermost layer of skin, promotes the growth of collagen, and improves hyperpigmentation due to sun damage.</li>
 	<li><strong>Laser Therapy</strong> - Short pulses of intense, concentrated light remove targeted layers or areas of the skin’s surface, reducing facial wrinkles, scarring, blemishes and uneven skin tone.</li>
 	<li><strong>Chemical Peels</strong> - Chemical peels remove sun damaged skin from the upper layers. You can apply some peels, such as alpha-hydroxy or salicylic acid creams, yourself. A deeper peel is performed by a dermatologist.</li>
</ul>
While some of <a href=\"http://www.skincancer.org/healthy-lifestyle/anti-aging/repair-and-even-reverse-signs-of-sun-damage\">the effects of photoaging can be reversed and significantly improved</a>, prevention is your best bet. Wear a broad spectrum (containing UVA and UVB protection) sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher, every day, regardless of your skin color or tone, and whether it’s sunny or cloudy outside. Regularly wearing protection from the sun’s rays will, over time, help reduce the appearance of previous damage while also decreasing your chances of developing skin cancer and further problems.

Believe it or not, recess for adults is incredibly valuable, in terms of both individual health and workplace performance.

Our modern environment has made it very difficult to unplug. It can be a real challenge to take even a few moments away from work, let alone the constant stream of social media and news updates. That’s why planned recess for adults can be such an important release valve. Check out these strategies for creating a more balanced, recess-enhanced office culture that recharges employees, improving their productivity and healthiness.

<strong>Recess for Adults Starts with Lunch Outside the Office</strong>

This is perhaps the simplest way of rejuvenating employees. Researchers have found that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/9992980/Workers-more-positive-if-they-eat-outside-the-office-study-finds.html\">workers who ate their lunches outside</a> ranked higher in overall happiness than those who ate at their desks. The study applied a happiness index score (calculated using results from psychological tests and self-evaluation) to the various outside locations where employees had lunch. Those workers who ate at the beach experienced the biggest increase in happiness, followed by those eating lunch in a public green space or park, eating at home with loved ones, and eating at a restaurant. By contrast, workers who ate lunch at their desks were found to have the lowest levels of happiness.

Considering how often people stay tethered to their cubicles, this is an issue. <a href=\"http://www.right.com/wps/wcm/connect/right-us-en/home/thoughtwire/categories/media-center/Just+OneinFive+Employees+Take+Actual+Lunch+Break\">A survey conducted by Right Management</a> found that fewer than half of employees take lunch away from their desks, while 14 percent of respondents reported taking almost no lunch breaks at all. Michael Haid, the firm’s Senior Vice President for Talent Management, warns that too many companies are creating cultures where employees feel uneasy spending even half an hour away from their desks for lunch.

<strong>Skipping Lunch Breaks is Bad for Everyone</strong>

Such pressure does not help employee wellbeing, nor does it benefit the company’s bottom line. Research shows that forcing the brain to work without rest is detrimental to overall creativity and performance, and it harms long-term health. This kind of work strategy elevates the risks of burnout and fatigue, with workers’ enthusiasm and engagement steadily decreasing over time. Employers who cultivate a <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/workplace-wellness-creates-healthy-business/\">culture of wellness</a>, from encouraging adequate lunch breaks to implementing <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-physical-examination/\">preventative care programs</a>, decrease their overall overhead in terms of employee medical costs and absenteeism. Such a culture also boosts productivity levels over time.

<strong>Recess for Adults: Breaking Beyond Lunch</strong>

There are any number of great ideas that fall under the umbrella of “recess for adults.” For instance, while many employees may schedule exercise or yoga routines for before or after work, allowing them to break up the day with a midday session could do wonders for overall energy levels and productivity. Other activities, such as puzzles or reading, keep the brain active while giving it a respite from job-related tasks. Recess could mean something as simple as going for a short walk or listening to music. It could also be a group activity with co-workers, such as sports or team-building games. There’s a huge range of options. What’s most important is to make sure employees have the opportunity to take some kind of mental and/or physical “recess” from their daily routine so that their focus remains high.

<strong>Recess for Adults is Productive</strong>

Science shows us that incorporating playfulness and rest into the workplace leads to more adaptable, innovative, and creative workers. Playfully enriched work environments positively impact and shape the cerebral cortex, which is the part of the brain where the most complex and powerful cognitive processing occurs. <a href=\"http://www.nifplay.org/opportunities/corporate-innovation/\">The National Institute for Play</a> offers consulting for corporations looking to revamp their operations into more enriched environments. The NIFP approach to cultivating more play-informed work cultures uses data to design enrichment programs best suited to a company’s specific needs. The benefits of recess for adults include breaking up outdated or ineffective cognitive patterns, increasing creativity and creative problem-solving skills, and stress reduction. It elevates cognitive function while improving community connections and team building in the workplace. In a variety of ways, recess for adults can be a major advantage for any company and its workforce.

3899,8,"2017-07-19 18:42:48","2017-07-19 18:42:48","Science is proving what many have known for centuries: the benefits of meditation <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/health_benefits_of_meditation/\">are exciting and profound</a>. There are countless ways to meditate and innumerable advantages. Discover what works for you by <a href=\"https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-11317/11-easy-ways-to-meditate-even-if-it-seems-impossible.html\">exploring different approaches</a>, and then be sure to invest the time in making it a routine part of your life.

A regular meditation practice enhances creativity and productivity at work, and it improves long-term health outcomes in a variety of areas. As little as five minutes of meditation a day can quickly reduce stress and anxiety. But the benefits of meditation go beyond that. Spending 20 minutes to an hour each day meditating (even for just a few weeks) is scientifically demonstrated to:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Increase and enhance the body’s immune response</strong>.</li>
</ul>
Researchers from Harvard Medical School have shown that subjects who practice <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/meditation\">yoga and meditation</a> have improved mitochondrial energy production and function, which results in increased immunity and resilience against stress.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Improve cognitive function and focus</strong>.</li>
</ul>
In a study conducted at the University of California, meditators showed a sharp increase in their ability to focus, particularly on boring or repetitive tasks. Subjects also improved their performance in tests of cognitive skill and information processing, and in some cases demonstrated ten times the ability of the non-meditating group. There is also <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/\">evidence</a> that regular meditators develop a thicker prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula, and that a consistent meditation practice can offset <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/how_do_i_prevent_cognitive_impairment_and_dementia/\">cognitive decline in old age</a>.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Prevent and reduce addictive behaviors and emotional eating patterns</strong>.</li>
</ul>
Scientists have found that meditation reduces emotional eating, and increased mindfulness generally helps us avoid unhealthy indulgences. A healthy diet is a cornerstone of any good preventative health care plan, and the benefits of meditation include the facilitation of positive habits in this regard.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Decrease anxiety, mood disorders, and depression</strong>.</li>
</ul>
In a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130315095916.htm\">study</a> conducted in Belgium with 400 students ranging from 13 to 20 years old, an in-school mindfulness meditation program decreased incidents of depression, stress, and anxiety. Students were also shown to be less vulnerable to pronounced and major symptoms of depression with regular meditation practice. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:COTR.0000045557.15923.96\">Another study</a> shows that mindfulness meditation practice helps those with a history of depression to decrease cognitive dysfunction, negative thinking patterns, and rumination.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Improve self-esteem</strong>.</li>
</ul>
A healthy sense of self-esteem helps us commit to self-care, and make positive choices for ourselves in order to improve our health and our lives: all key components to a sound preventative health care plan. <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/blog/2015/06/09/how-does-meditation-impact-self-esteem/\">Meditation</a> helps us learn to observe and question our thoughts as they arise. Instead of being swept up in an internal mental narrative, particularly a negative or overly critical one, we learn to create space around our thoughts and emotions in order to examine them. We also learn to release thoughts which harm us or hinder our sense of intrinsic self-worth. Authentic self-esteem is supported by an understanding of our inherent value and worth, and this is a sense of self we don’t have to prove. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ed-and-deb-shapiro/meditation-self-esteem_b_1803862.html\">Mindfulness</a> meditation is a powerful way to improve self-esteem, and as a result we tend to make healthier and more compassionate choices for ourselves.

<strong>Popular Meditation Styles</strong><strong> </strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Mindfulness Meditation </strong>– This technique aims to create a non-judgmental and relaxed ability to observe thoughts, sensations, and emotions as they arise on a moment by moment basis. The technique is as simple as setting aside time each day to sit, focus on deep belly breathing, and experience these internal events as they unfold. Mindfulness trains us to declutter the mind, and become more present and observant of the world around us. Instead of operating on auto-pilot, we learn to pay attention in each moment of our lives.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Apps for Mindfulness Meditation Training</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Headspace</strong> - A great app for people learning meditation for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a> offers 10 free beginner-focused, mindfulness meditation sessions of 10 minutes apiece. Once you have completed this “Take 10” set, the app unlocks additional meditation sessions for purchase as you progress.</li>
 	<li><strong>Smiling Mind </strong>- This <a href=\"http://smilingmind.com.au/\">app</a> offers meditation sessions for all age groups, from children to adults. Educators can also use Smiling Mind to create meditation time in the classroom.</li>
 	<li><strong>Stop, Breathe &amp; Think </strong>- Offering 55 guided mindfulness meditation sessions, as well as a mood tracker and customizable chimes, the <a href=\"https://app.stopbreathethink.org/\">Stop, Breathe &amp; Think</a> app has programs designed to assist with depression, sleep, anxiety, and cultivating greater compassion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Transcendental Meditation </strong>– This technique is taught for a fee by a certified teacher. <a href=\"http://www.tm.org/\">Transcendental Meditation</a> is a silent mantra style of meditation which does not involve the self-monitoring of mindfulness techniques. TM is considered helpful as a way to increase relaxation, stress relief, and personal development.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vipassana Meditation</strong> – This technique is one of the most ancient, and has been taught in India for more than 2500 years. <a href=\"https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index\">Vipassana</a> is taught free of charge by trained instructors, with donations requested as able, during 10-day training sessions around the world. This training involves mental focus on the breath while contemplating the nature of impermanence, or change, in order to generate greater peace and self-understanding.</li>
</ul>
Regardless of the meditation style you choose, consistency is key. In order to reap the myriad benefits of meditation, it is important to establish a regular practice. The more we meditate, the better we will feel. Meditation makes individuals happier, physically and mentally healthier, and better equipped to deal with stress. The benefits of meditation can no longer be ignored.

3901,8,"2017-07-19 20:20:23","2017-07-19 20:20:23","Workplace stress is a <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/symptoms-of-stress/\">huge problem</a> for employees and companies alike. According to researchers, it costs U.S. businesses as much as $407 billion per year, and is a <a href=\"https://news.uci.edu/health/uci-suny-research-details-how-workplace-stress-contributes-to-cardiovascular-disease/\">major contributor to cardiovascular disease</a>. This is a staggering health and financial crisis. At least half of all workers are believed to suffer from stress and tension, and 66 percent of all employees report that their work performance suffers as a result. Poorly managed stress is the main cause of long-term employee absenteeism, and medical experts say that unmanaged stress is the primary cause of illnesses representing up to 70 percent of visits to primary care physicians.

Research shows that chronic stress harms cognitive function and creativity, problem solving skills, decision making, motivation, planning, the ability to effectively strategize, morale, retention, and revenue. Chronic stress undermines employee wellbeing on multiple levels, as well as any company goal that depends on a healthy workforce. Clearly, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/symptoms-of-stress/\">stress management</a> should be an essential component to any company’s employee health care program. The long-term costs in terms of medical bills, interpersonal conflict, errors, and absenteeism are far more financially draining to businesses than the cost of good <a href=\"http://www.worktolive.info/stress-management\">stress management</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/Features/PreventionStrategy/\">preventative health care programs</a>.

<strong>Workplace Stress is Contagious</strong>

Humans are intrinsically social, and we mirror one another’s moods and emotions. Therefore, stress symptoms spread among people who work closely together. Employees are also impacted by the stress levels of disgruntled supervisors, management personnel, and their organizing teams. The dynamics of employees’ various office interactions and interpersonal relationships all have a direct bearing on their stress levels.

<strong>Employee Wellbeing Means More Than Physical Health</strong>

Maintaining good health requires attention to nutrition and exercise, of course, but physical care alone is insufficient in ensuring overall wellbeing. The management of workplace stress is essential to preventing chronic illness. Ample <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1084.html\">research</a> shows that when employees experience stress from work, financial, or family concerns, their health suffers and productivity declines.

<strong>What is the Cost of Workplace Stress?</strong>

Health management company <a href=\"http://staywell.com/\">StayWell</a> evaluated the costs of stress, comparing them to those associated with 10 other common health-risk factors. The analysis determined that while obesity, tobacco use, alcohol dependency, high cholesterol, and hypertension comprised 25 percent of companies’ overall healthcare expenditures, stress was the single most costly risk to both employees’ health and an employer’s bottom line.

<strong>How and Why Does Workplace Stress Cause Illness?</strong>

When the brain detects stress, its fight or flight response is activated. Heightened levels of stress hormones – cortisol and norepinephrine – are released into the bloodstream. Over time, if this response becomes chronic, the body will start responding with symptoms linked to a person’s particular physical vulnerabilities. Some individuals will have panic attacks; others may begin having migraines, cardiovascular issues, or problems regulating blood sugar. Stress reactions can also be behavioral: poor eating habits, reliance on tobacco, or alcohol dependency and drug abuse can be responses to chronic stress as well.

<strong>Ideas and Solutions for Workplace Stress Management</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Provide low cost yoga, tai chi, and/or gym memberships for employees</li>
 	<li>Allow employees the option of working from home one day per week</li>
 	<li>Offer meditation classes</li>
 	<li>Encourage a one hour lunch break taken away from the office, or at least a full half-hour break</li>
 	<li>Replace vending machine junk food with healthy snacks and pure water</li>
 	<li>Encourage breaks away from the desk - particularly when stress hits</li>
 	<li>Organize meetings outside when possible</li>
 	<li>Invest in stress management and preventative health care programs for employees</li>
</ul>
American work culture has become increasingly stressful in recent decades. Our healthcare system sometimes neglects the impact of psychological factors and how they influence our overall health. In order to prevent and manage chronic illnesses, thereby lowering healthcare costs, it is essential to create office environments that offer workplace stress relief and management to employees.

3933,8,"2017-07-20 18:40:48","2017-07-20 18:40:48","Stress management techniques are central to a healthy lifestyle. Moderate stress can motivate us and increase concentration and clarity. But when life or <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/preventing-workplace-stress/\">workplace stress</a> becomes chronic, we begin to experience detrimental symptoms as the pressure accumulates. Chronic stress harms our mental and physical wellbeing, and <a href=\"https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/stress-management.htm\">learning to cope with stressors</a> is vital to any preventative health strategy. Here are 10 stress management techniques to help you deal with stress before it becomes a big problem.
<ol>
 	<li>Exercise at least three times per week. <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/health-benefits-of-exercise-is-a-fountain-of-youth/\">When you exercise</a>, your body releases endorphins, which help you relax and feel better amid stress. Some types of exercise, such as yoga, additionally stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system (the part of your nervous system which resets and calms your stress response). Regular exercise also improves sleep, giving you two stress management techniques in one.</li>
 	<li>Evidence shows that a regular mindfulness <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/about-meditation/\">meditation</a> practice decreases symptoms of stress and anxiety while increasing stress resilience and feelings of calm. Meditation is also good cognitive training – it leads us to recognize negative thought patterns and release them over time. Regular practice only intensifies these benefits, so find a <a href=\"http://liveanddare.com/types-of-meditation/\">method</a> you enjoy and make it part of your self-care regimen.</li>
 	<li>Try progressive muscle relaxation (also known as deep muscle relaxation). Progressively tense each muscle group of your body, and then breathe deeply and release. This is particularly helpful to do before sleep as a way of releasing the day’s stress.</li>
 	<li>Make a to-do list of important work and personal tasks you need to accomplish each day. Working through your daily list will help you feel organized and on top of things, giving you a sense of mastery over your workload.</li>
 	<li>Eat a nutritious diet based on whole, natural foods. Make time to sit, rest, and eat your meals mindfully. Try to avoid eating under stress or in a rush. Mealtimes are break times. Avoid stressful and upsetting conversation while eating.</li>
 	<li>Practice good <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/how_to_keep_good_sleep_hygiene/\">sleep hygiene</a>. Structure your sleep so that you are going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. Lower the lights and turn off your phone and devices at least one hour before bedtime, and sleep in a well darkened room.</li>
 	<li>Try diaphragmatic breathing. When we are stressed, our breathing tends to be shallow and centered in the chest. Diaphragmatic breathing (<a href=\"https://psychcentral.com/lib/learning-deep-breathing/\">deep breathing</a>) helps to regulate the body’s stress response, and increases feelings of calm.</li>
 	<li>Seek support. Find at least one person you can confide in and with whom you can share concerns. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921311/\">The more social support you have, the more stress resilience</a> you will develop. If you find yourself isolated, you may have to take steps to create more community in your life. Seek out new activities, join an <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/join-adult-recreational-sports-team/\">adult recreational sports team</a> for camaraderie and exercise, or take a new class to connect with others who have common interests.</li>
 	<li>Really, it’s as simple as that. Watch funny movies or stand-up comedians you like. Find amusing YouTube videos or a hilarious book. Regular <a href=\"https://www.helpguide.org/articles/emotional-health/laughter-is-the-best-medicine.htm\">laughter</a> is one of the easiest and most reliable stress management techniques. It lowers stress hormones in the body, relaxes muscles, and helps you keep perspective.</li>
 	<li>Learn to say no. <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/setting-boundaries-for-stress-management-3144985\">Set boundaries</a> around your life demands and workload as much as possible to avoid becoming overwhelmed. Delegate responsibilities when possible and as needed, and give yourself permission to set limits in terms of how much you take on at any given time. You may encounter some friction with others as they adjust to the new boundaries you set, but you are ensuring healthier relationships with them – and improved long-term mental and physical health for yourself – by learning to say no.</li>
</ol>
In sum, cultivating a set of stress management techniques that work for you is a key component of preventative health care. Stress is a major contributing factor to the development of many mental and physical illnesses. Making time for self-care is important to staying healthy in the long term. It may take some effort to carve out the time for exercise and meditation, for instance, but your wellbeing is worth the investment.

3936,8,"2017-09-18 13:00:47","2017-09-18 13:00:47","You've likely heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. There are countless benefits to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/healthy-eating-patterns/\">eating a nutritious breakfast</a> — including a higher metabolism, weight loss, normalized blood sugar, and a better mood. Unfortunately, mornings can also be hectic, so adding a <a href=\"http://www.health.com/food/cheap-healthy-foods\">healthy but delicious breakfast</a> to your routine may feel impossible.

Grab-and-go breakfasts make sense when you’re pressed for time, but too often people reach for sugar-filled pastries or other easy but unhealthy options. We have a solution. Try these healthy blueberry muffins, which are gluten free, loaded with antioxidants, and contain no processed sugar!

<strong>Healthy Blueberry Muffins Deliver Antioxidants</strong>

Healthy blueberry muffins take advantage of one of nature's <a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-benefits-of-blueberries#section1\">most nutritionally beneficial fruits</a>. Blueberries are high in antioxidants. What does that mean?

Many stressors, ranging from smoking to exercising, can lead to the formation of free radicals in our bodies. This creates a risk for excessive inflammation, damage to our DNA, and chronic issues like cancer and heart disease.

Some free radical formation is normal, which is why the body produces antioxidants on its own. However, this function decreases as we age, and it simply isn't sufficient to deal with the level of toxins we are exposed to through modern pollution, stress and diet. As a result, it is crucial to consume antioxidants through our diet. Many organic vegetables and fruits are rich in antioxidants. Blueberries are believed to have the highest concentration among common fruits and vegetables. They are particularly high in flavonoids, a type of antioxidant that gives blueberries their rich color, and are also helpful in detoxifying our system.

<strong>Choose Whole Flours and Sugars</strong>

We've chosen oatmeal rather than processed white flour for this healthy blueberry muffins recipe. Oatmeal is denser in fiber, which facilitates digestion. It also helps lower cholesterol and slows the rate at which sugars enter the blood stream. Coconut palm sugar is also known for having a milder impact on blood sugar levels. It is important to choose foods that don't cause spikes in our blood sugar in order to create more stable hunger levels, mood, and a healthier weight. When we regularly eat foods that cause jumps in blood sugar — like white bread, pasta, and sugary desserts — we also risk insulin resistance and eventually Type 2 diabetes.

<strong>Ingredients for Healthy Blueberry Muffins:</strong>

6-12 ounces blueberries (<em>depending on your preference</em>)

4086,8,"2017-08-07 09:30:49","2017-08-07 09:30:49","There’s real value in great staycation ideas. While <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/walking-tours/\">vacations away</a> are crucial for rest and family bonding, the <a href=\"http://traveltips.usatoday.com/much-cost-vacation-14241.html\">financial cost</a> of journeys far from home can be steep. Or you may simply prefer to spend quality time with loved ones and friends who live near you. Either way, a staycation can be a great opportunity to explore aspects of your home city that you may be too busy to enjoy when work and school schedules are in full swing. And beyond the importance of family togetherness, individual rest and relaxation are vital to good mental and physical health.

Here are some staycation ideas to help you decide whether to stay close to home for R&amp;R the next chance you get:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Be a tourist in your home town </strong>- A staycation is the perfect chance to visit museums and galleries and to attend live theater or musical performances. See sites unique to your hometown, taking a look through fresh eyes. Check out some restaurants you’ve been too busy to try. You work hard to make a home where you do, so take this opportunity to appreciate it.</li>
 	<li><strong>Host a family game night </strong>- Whether you prefer board games or cards, make game night extra fun with special prizes for the winners.</li>
 	<li><strong>Play laser tag or paintball</strong> - There are laser tag and paintball locations everywhere, so find one nearby and engage in some friendly competition.</li>
 	<li><strong>Book a night or two at a hotel </strong>- Order room service, and enjoy a couple of days off with no laundry, no chores, and no household responsibilities.</li>
 	<li><strong>Plan a picnic at a nearby national park</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/findapark/index.htm\">Find a national park</a> in your area, and take advantage of some fresh air and scenic beauty. Many parks have family friendly activities, from hiking and biking trails to sports facilities, so pack a picnic and enjoy the day.</li>
 	<li><strong>Visit a local water or amusement park </strong>- Check out this <a href=\"http://www.themeparkcity.com/USA_index.htm\">list of theme parks</a> for one in your area, and enjoy a great family outing at a fraction of the cost of Disney World.</li>
 	<li><strong>Camp out in the backyard </strong>- Pitch a tent, grill up some dinner, roast marshmallows, tell your favorite ghost stories, and enjoy sleeping out under the stars.</li>
 	<li><strong>Visit the local library </strong>- Libraries have lots of options for family friendly events, starting with story times for young children year-round. Activities are particularly plentiful on the weekends and during spring and summer breaks. Check your local library’s website for details.</li>
 	<li><strong>Go river rafting, paddle boarding, or kayaking </strong>- If there is a river or body of water nearby, check out guided rafting, kayaking, canoeing, or paddle boarding excursions. Get outside, enjoy the water and fresh air, and develop some new skills.</li>
 	<li><strong>Enjoy local food and art festivals </strong>- Many cities host seasonal bazaars, art and food festivals, and carnivals. Check out your local community events calendar for more information.</li>
 	<li><strong>Plan a family arts and crafts day</strong> - Find your local arts and crafts center or paint-your-own ceramics studio, and create some beautiful new artwork for your household.</li>
 	<li><strong>Go </strong><a href=\"https://www.geocaching.com/guide/\"><strong>Geocaching</strong></a> - Geocaching is an outdoor, GPS-directed global treasure hunt. Players navigate a set of GPS coordinates, trying to find the geocache (hidden container) at a certain location. You can also find local Geocaching groups in your area.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Make Sure Staycation Ideas Are Turned Into Action</strong>

For many of us, the biggest challenge of taking a staycation is letting go of the routine responsibilities we feel pressured to abide when we’re at home, in our “regular” environment. Be sure your staycation ideas allow you to institute boundaries around your time off. Let the heavy housework go for a week. Don’t cook at home (unless you find it fun and relaxing). Shut off phones and devices. Give yourself permission to rest, enjoy your loved ones, and just be.

4091,8,"2017-08-01 09:12:40","2017-08-01 09:12:40","A sunny day at the beach is the perfect time to get some exercise with <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/outdoor-sports/\">outdoor sports</a> and activities. What are some of the best games to play at the beach? The following suggestions are all great ways for the whole family <a href=\"http://activeforlife.com/21-active-beach-games/\">to have fun while staying active</a> in the surf and the sand.

<strong>Five Fun Games to Play at the Beach:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Volleyball</strong> - The quintessential beach game, volleyball is perfect for groups of all sizes, ages, and ability levels. Many beaches will have nets set up already, so all you need is a ball and a crew of people ready for some friendly competition.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"http://ladderball.org/\"><strong>Ladder Ball</strong></a> - Similar to horseshoes, Ladder Ball is easy to play and appropriate for players of all ages. It is particularly great for the beach, because it’s easy to stick the ladders into the sand and remove them when you’re done. The game is played with at least two players or teams. Each player gets 3 bolas, which are balls linked by a nylon cord. The goal is to score points by wrapping the bola around one of the ladder rungs. Kits can be purchased at your local sporting goods store or online.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"http://beachbocce.com/rules/\"><strong>Bocce</strong></a> - This classic Italian bowling game dates back to ancient Rome, but has become even more popular in recent times as a beach game. A bocce set includes 8 large balls, and one small ball called the pallino (or “pill”), which is tossed first and serves as the target. Everyone takes turns trying to get the larger balls closest to the pallino.</li>
 	<li><strong>Sharks and Minnows </strong>- This game can be played on the beach, or in gentle, shallow waters. One player is the shark, and the others are the minnows. The shark tries to tag the minnows, and as minnows are tagged, they become part of the shark’s team, and try to tag the other minnows to gain members for the shark’s team. To make the game more challenging, try blindfolding the shark.</li>
 	<li><strong>Beach Darts </strong>- The simplest way to play beach darts is to draw concentric circles in the sand until you have what resembles a dartboard. Players then stand at a distance, throwing shells or pebbles as “darts,” trying to get as close as possible to the bull’s eye.</li>
</ol>
We understand that beach days are also for watching the waves, laying in the sand (maybe even using it to preserve memories via <a href=\"https://dunejewelry.com\">Dune Jewelry</a>), and generally relaxing. But these games to play at the beach are easy, fun ways to promote family fitness. It’s important to encourage loved ones, particularly children who are forming healthy habits, to seek out exercise whenever possible. If you take advantage of the opportunities summer offers in this regard, it’s far easier to stay motivated to stay in shape once the warmer months draw to a close. These games to play at the beach are just a start. After all, the ultimate goal is to make fitness a lifestyle choice year-round!

This recipe for grilled shrimp skewers adds a nutritious, delicious option to your menu. It’s easy to cook, and the flavorful sauce can be stored in the fridge for a week, making it simple to prepare in advance. See how to make these incredible grilled shrimp skewers with pesto sauce below!

<strong>Behold the Nutritional Power of Shrimp</strong>

Shrimp is an excellent low-calorie source of protein. A dozen shrimp can total just 85-100 calories while packing 15 grams of protein! Protein is a crucial macronutrient to include at every meal. Aiming for at least 15-20 grams per meal is a good general goal in order to increase satiety, keep you full longer, and maintain muscle mass.

Muscle burns more calories than other forms of tissue, so maintaining muscle is a great way to improve metabolic function, boost energy, and strengthen overall health. A useful guideline is that each meal should keep you full for 4-6 hours, which helps to prevent mindless snacking or impulsive food choices. If you're hungry much sooner than 4 hours after a meal, it may mean you ate too little, had simple carbohydrates which caused a blood sugar spike and quick drop, or didn't include enough protein. Besides keeping you full, protein slows the rate at which food is digested and absorbed. This helps to steady blood sugar levels, thereby stabilizing mood and energy, as well as preventing diabetes.

Shrimp is also rich in selenium, a mineral that helps to counter free radicals and oxidation throughout the body. It's also been shown to prevent certain types of cancers. Selenium's anti-inflammation and -oxidation properties also decrease the risk of heart disease. Additionally, good thyroid health necessitates adequate selenium since it's required for the production of thyroid hormone. The thyroid regulates metabolism, which affects weight and energy levels. Selenium also boosts immunity, helping ward off common colds and the flu.

<strong>Pesto Sauce Boosts Flavor and Health</strong>

The pesto sauce in this recipe comes with many of its own health benefits. Mint is <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/digestive_health/\">incredible for digestion</a>, helping to fight inflammation in the gut and keeping things moving smoothly. Spinach is high in fiber, meaning it's also good for digestion, and because it's served raw it retains full micronutrient advantages. Garlic is incredible for immunity; it's antibacterial and antiviral, helping to ward off bad bacteria in the digestive tract. It also contains allicin, which stimulates immunity cells and keeps your immune system at peak performance. Overall, these grilled shrimp skewers offer a lot in the way of both nutrition and taste.

4179,8,"2017-08-11 09:30:27","2017-08-11 09:30:27","A Mediterranean diet wards off disease, promotes wellness, and keeps weight healthy and stable. But what characterizes this <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801\">approach to nutrition</a>? Well, you'll find people in the Mediterranean region eating lots of <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/preferred_source_of_vitamins/\">fresh vegetables and fruits</a>, unprocessed grains, seafood, high-protein (and high-quality) dairy, raw nuts, and, of course, olive oil. If you're looking to eat this way, most of your grocery shopping can be done around the perimeter of the store (think proteins and tons of produce), with limited trips to center aisles for certain grains, nuts, and legumes. While you may not be changing your whole diet just yet, we encourage you to try this flavorful Mediterranean quinoa salad as a delicious gateway to Mediterranean cuisine.

<strong>Mediterranean Quinoa Salad: An Excellent Source of Protein</strong>

Quinoa is one of the only plant protein sources that is a \"complete\" protein. The body produces many amino acids on its own, but there are nine amino acids we must consume in food, and they are crucial for survival. These are called essential amino acids, and quinoa contains all nine of them. Just one cup of this heart-healthy grain has eight grams of protein, meaning regularly including it in your diet can shave off the number of animal products you need as protein sources. Lowering your overall consumption of animal products is great for the environment and lowers your risk of diseases like cancer and heart disease. This Mediterranean quinoa salad is the perfect way to get protein.

<strong>Olive Oil Promotes Heart Health</strong>

Olive oil is rich in <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/dietary-fat/\">monounsaturated fats</a>, which are often missing in the modern American diet. The fatty acids in olive oil are called oleic acid. Oleic acid has been shown to reduce inflammation throughout the body, which promotes health and helps to prevent a slew of diseases. In addition to the health benefits of its type of fat, olive oil also contains a concentration of antioxidants shown to fight free radicals, improve skin health, and prevent cancer. The antioxidants can be damaged by exposure to light and heat, so always store olive oil in a dark and cool spot.

<strong>It's All About the Herbs </strong>

Every ingredient in this Mediterranean quinoa salad was chosen to promote health. Each vegetable is rich in antioxidants, which are important for counteracting the damaging pollutants, poor food choices, and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/manage_your_stress_with_these_techniques/\">stress we face each day</a>. But it's not just the veggies that improve our wellness - both garlic and parsley come with their own benefits, too. Garlic in its raw form will not only add bite to the dish, but also stimulate the immune system and help fight off illness.

Parsley is an herb you'll find in many Mediterranean dishes. It has long been used in the region to help diabetic patients, as parsley has been shown to keep blood sugar levels stable. Adding it to your dishes can help prevent insulin resistance, maintain energy levels, and even fight irritability. It's a great way to top this Mediterranean quinoa salad.

4203,8,"2017-08-09 09:30:52","2017-08-09 09:30:52","Do you make good use of outdoor space at work? It’s more important than you may think.

Spending too much time indoors creates what health experts call a <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/people-in-nature/200901/no-more-nature-deficit-disorder\">“nature deficit disorder”</a>: increased depression and anxiety rooted in disconnection from the natural world. And while enjoying <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/outdoor-sports/\">outdoor sports</a> and recreation during your time off is always a great idea, so too is making a habit of going outside during the workday. It helps to reduce stress, improve immunity, and lower blood pressure.

Taking outdoor breaks refreshes our perspectives (and bodies) so we can return to work recharged. It also gives the brain some rest, which boosts focus, creativity, and productivity. Nature has a way of giving us a clearer, calmer state of mind. Here are some tips for utilizing outdoor space at work for a healthier, happier day:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Schedule Walking Meetings </strong>– Host meetings outside, where your team can walk and talk, creating a great opportunity to incorporate outdoor activity into the workday while still being productive. Stepping out of the office and into the fresh air can help reinvigorate workers. It triggers creativity and brainstorming while also offering immediate stress relief.</li>
 	<li><strong>Provide Adequate Breaks </strong>– Allow time for employees to take an unrushed lunch break of at least half an hour, although a full hour is even better. Taking lunches outside, whether at a nearby park or outdoor cafe, is a great way to boost moods and morale. It’s excellent for productivity and overall wellbeing. Besides lunch, 10- or 15-minute walk breaks, taken in the fresh air, also do wonders for stress relief.</li>
 	<li><strong>Incorporate Fitness Opportunities </strong>– It’s always a good idea to encourage exercise, and it’s even more beneficial when there are outdoor opportunities for fitness. Some suggestions:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li>Provide an area where workers can store bikes to support cycling commutes.</li>
 	<li>Schedule after-work employee kickball games in the parking lot.</li>
 	<li>Organize a <a href=\"http://www.rrca.org/\">running club</a>.</li>
 	<li>Offer <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/outdoor-yoga/\">outdoor yoga</a> classes at a local park in the summer months.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Bring Greenery into the Office</strong> – Fill the office with (real) plants, and try to set up a business space with as many windows – and as much light – as possible.</li>
 	<li><strong>Encourage Outdoor Workspaces </strong>– Employees who can work on laptops can do work outside when possible. Time out of the office can boost mood and energy, making employees healthier and more productive.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Outdoor Space at Work: The Many Benefits of Nature</strong>

A recent University of Rochester study shows that spending time in nature <a href=\"http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=3639\">increases feelings of vitality and joy</a>. Being outside manages both to energize and calm; it is restorative to physical and psychological wellbeing alike. Research demonstrates that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/23/walk-nature-depression_n_5870134.html\">a daily walk outdoors</a>, particularly with a group or partner, reduces depression and increases feelings of happiness. Getting outdoors is good for our mental and emotional health, increases creativity and focus, and helps relieve stress. Making opportunities to use outdoor space at work during the week fosters <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/workplace-wellness-creates-healthy-business/\">employee wellness and helps business</a>. People are more productive when they take intermittent time away from their desks to enjoy nature. It’s a win-win for workers and employers.

Whether you’re traveling for business or pleasure, any international journey should be planned with your health taken into consideration. When you’re in unfamiliar places, far from the comforts of home or your regular physician, it’s always wise to have prepared for the trip with a comprehensive travel medicine plan. Check out these tips below to make sure you’re ready.

<strong>Travel Medicine Action Steps Checklist</strong><strong> </strong>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>See your doctor before you travel. </strong>You may require <a href=\"https://www.vaccines.gov/travel/index.html\">vaccinations</a>, whether routine or specific to the region where you are traveling. Your doctor will be able to assess if you need any vaccinations for safe travel to your destinations. If you have been ill recently, your physician can also determine whether you are well enough to travel and which precautions to take. Additionally, seeing a doctor can be important in case you have a preexisting medical condition and need to incorporate it into travel insurance coverage before embarking on your journey.</li>
 	<li><strong>Assess your overall health. </strong>Consider any recent illnesses, injuries, or surgeries you’ve had, and determine whether you are currently well enough to travel. Do you have any specific health needs that may require special attention in the context of travel? Are you pregnant or planning to make the trip with an infant or child whose own needs (such as an inhaler for asthma) are relevant to an international travel plan?</li>
 	<li><strong>Research your destination. </strong>Learn about the place where you’re going and any associated health risks. For more information, check out the <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list\">Center for Disease Control (CDC) and their destination page</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Check for Travel Health Notices. </strong>The CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) regularly post and update destination-specific <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices\">travel notices and warnings</a> on their websites. It is wise to be aware of any health or weather alerts before you leave. Some areas are more prone to extreme weather or natural disasters, or may be experiencing an illness outbreak, so be sure to check. Refer to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/index.html\">CDC’s Natural Disasters and Severe Weather Page</a> for more information.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pack smart. </strong>In addition to your other essentials, be sure to include a travel health kit for your carry-on luggage. Include prescribed and over-the-counter medications you can’t do without, as well as copies of your prescriptions and the drugs’ generic names. You will need a note on letterhead stationery from your prescribing physician for all drugs and injectable medications, and you should leave an extra copy at home with someone you can reach. Be sure to check with the American embassy or consulate in your to ensure your specific medications are permitted entry into the country. Also, pack a first aid kit, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/always-wear-sunscreen/\">sunscreen</a>, and any over health-related products you may need.</li>
 	<li><strong>Purchase </strong><a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/11/21/how-to-choose-health-insurance-if-you-travel-frequently\"><strong>travel medical insurance</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Unpredictable illnesses and accidents can happen while traveling, and the amount of travel coverage provided by your domestic insurance provider may be limited or non-existent. Depending on where you are traveling, foreign visitors without travel health insurance may have to pay out of pocket for any medical care required. Those costs can be considerable, especially if you sustain serious injury or illness. Make sure you and your family are covered.</li>
 	<li><strong>Take care of your health during your trip. </strong>Some travel medicine simply comes down to using common sense and acting even more cautiously than you might at home. Use sunscreen and insect repellent when necessary. Be careful to get food and water from clean sources. Don’t overindulge in alcohol. Be sure to wear your seatbelt when in a car and protective equipment when enjoying adventure activities. Always respect your host country’s local laws, customs, and etiquette. In essence, limit opportunities for threats to your health or wellbeing.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pay attention to your health when you get home. </strong>If you begin feeling ill upon your return, monitor your symptoms carefully and see your doctor.</li>
</ol>
Whether you are traveling abroad for the first time or regularly jet around the globe, remember to attend to your travel medicine needs before you embark on your journey. Your trip will be all the more enjoyable (and safe) if you are informed, protected, and well prepared before you leave home.

However, anti-aging tips at any age go beyond just what’s on your plate. To <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/promote-the-aging-process#1\">reverse the aging process</a>, it makes sense to embrace healthy lifestyle choices in a number of areas. Using these anti-aging tips at any age will help keep you feeling and looking great for years to come.

<strong>Prioritize Exercise</strong>

Exercise lowers stress, keeps your weight in check, and maintains strong, toned muscles. Regular workouts help you look and feel younger than your years. Research shows that older adults who stay in shape with an exercise regimen have fewer visible signs of aging, and their physiological functioning more closely mirrors that of younger adults.

<strong>Manage and Minimize Stress</strong>

Stress and stress-related hormones have a considerable aging effect on the body. Research suggests that this process begins at the cellular level. Stress and psychological distress contribute to physiological wear and strain on the body. It’s yet another good reason to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/symptoms-of-stress/\">manage stress</a> in your life by utilizing some of these tools:
<ul>
 	<li>Meditation</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://eheintl.com/outdoor-yoga/\">Yoga</a></li>
 	<li>Deep belly breathing</li>
 	<li>Spending time outside</li>
 	<li>Making art</li>
 	<li>Gardening</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/7974-chocolate-reduces-stress-study-finds.html\">Eating a little chocolate</a></li>
 	<li>Drinking some <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/stress-busting-herbal-teas-89634\">tea</a></li>
 	<li>Enjoying <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/12/13/adult-coloring-books-stress/76916842/\">adult coloring books</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>Get Enough Sleep</strong><strong> </strong>

One of the most overlooked anti-aging tips? Adequate rest. Deep sleep on a regular schedule is essential to feeling great and staying youthful. Sleep allows your body (and your skin) to regenerate, repair, and heal. <a href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20628881,00.html\">Certain foods</a> can help you sleep more deeply, and learning proper <a href=\"https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/sleep-hygiene\">sleep hygiene</a> is also important. Aim to get a solid eight hours of sleep each night, turn off your devices and lower the lights at least one hour before bedtime, and sleep in a well-darkened room or with a sleeping mask.

<strong>See Your Dermatologist</strong>

Your dermatologist is up to date on the best and latest anti-aging treatments for your skin, and may suggest treatments that will produce more dramatic results than you can achieve at home. Dermatologists offer various options to reverse the signs of premature aging from sun damage, and can also provide deeper exfoliating peels than what you can find over the counter or from your aesthetician. Consult with your doctor about treatment alternatives.

<strong>Always Wear Sunscreen</strong>

<a href=\"https://eheintl.com/always-wear-sunscreen/\">Daily use of sunscreen</a> not only helps prevent various forms of skin cancer, it also lessens the signs of accelerated aging. Applying a good sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, each and every day, will protect against sun damage and reduce associated effects like wrinkles, lines, and hyperpigmentation. It's one of the easiest anti-aging tips to follow.

<strong>Drink Water</strong>

Drink plenty of fresh, filtered water throughout the day. Water is how skin cells receive essential nutrients, and staying hydrated means you’ll be less susceptible to cracks and wrinkles. Depending on your activity level and body type, recommended amounts of daily water consumption vary. That said, it’s typically wise to try to drink about a liter each day.

<strong>Use a Retinoid</strong><strong> </strong>

Retinoids function as an excellent topical anti-aging treatment for the skin. Retinoids are compounds derived from vitamin A which have been shown to accelerate cell turnover, boost collagen, and unclog pores. They reduce oil and acne breakouts, while smoothing skin and brightening its appearance . For strong formulations, see your dermatologist for a prescription. Over-the-counter versions, while less concentrated, are still effective in many cases.

Not surprisingly, anti-aging tips tend to have many general health benefits. While aging is inevitable, adjusting your routines to slow its effects can do wonders for your overall wellness.

A diet of whole, natural foods with an emphasis on <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/organic-foods/\">fresh fruits and vegetables</a> can do wonders for your health and longevity.

Making good decisions about what you eat goes a long way toward maximizing wellness and preventing signs of premature aging.

<ol>
 	<li><strong>Blueberries</strong> - This super fruit contains more <a href=\"https://www.wildblueberries.com/health-research/antioxidants/\">antioxidants</a> than almost any other food.

These powerful veggies contain vital <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/52541-phytonutrients.html\">phytonutrient</a> and antioxidant compounds that help reduce sun-related skin damage. Spinach is also high in lutein and beta-carotene, which are proven to preserve skin elasticity.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cold Pressed Olive Oil </strong>- The beneficial fats in olive oil (<a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/omega-3-fats/\">omega-3s</a>) are excellent for circulation and cardiovascular health, and additionally promote a healthy glow to the skin.</li>
 	<li><strong>Nuts </strong>- Like olive oil, nuts are rich in valuable unsaturated fats. They also provide concentrated amounts of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals.</li>
 	<li><strong>Salmon </strong>- Cold water fish like salmon are rich in omega-3s, which help prevent cholesterol accumulation in the arteries and are excellent for heart health and circulation. Omega-3s also keep skin smooth, youthful, and elastic.</li>
 	<li><strong>Carrots</strong> - Orange foods like carrots, squash, and sweet potatoes are high in vitamin A (retinol), which helps skin appearance. Vitamin A is a powerful tool for cellular renewal and skin health. Carrots also contain vitamin K, vitamin B6, folate, and potassium, which together support the immune system and reduce cardiovascular risk.</li>
 	<li><strong>Avocados </strong>- These increasingly ubiquitous fruits have a number of healthy benefits, and they are prime anti-aging foods. Containing omega-3s and vitamin E, avocados can be valuable in fighting free radicals and stopping much of the damage associated with aging.</li>
 	<li><strong>Chocolate </strong>- Cacao is rich in flavanols, which help maintain healthy blood vessel function, thereby lowering the risk of kidney disease, dementia, hypertension (high blood pressure), and type 2 diabetes. In order to keep your intake of added sugars to a minimum, opt for dark chocolate varieties of 70 percent cacao or higher.</li>
 	<li><strong>Green Tea </strong>- This traditional tea is high in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748751/\">catechins</a>, which are powerful compounds for preventing hyperpigmentation from sun damage. Green tea is also a great source of polyphenols (antioxidants), which combat sun-related free radical damage and help reverse the effects of aging.</li>
 	<li><strong>Citrus Fruits </strong>- High in vitamin C, citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruits, lemons, and limes help the amino acids lysine and proline convert to collagen in the skin, promoting a smooth, supple, and youthful complexion. They have much to offer as anti-aging foods.</li>
</ol>
A diet heavy on refined sugars, starches, and processed and synthetic foods will lead to inflammation, accelerating those changes to the body we associate with “aging.” Anti-aging foods counter this process. The benefits of good nutrition include increased energy, better sleep, enhanced immunity, improved skin texture (and appearance), and longevity. The more you pivot toward whole and natural foods, especially fruits and vegetables like those mentioned above, the more likely you’ll be to look and feel great for years to come.

4236,8,"2017-12-25 08:00:55","2017-12-25 08:00:55","Meal Prep Sunday is just what it sounds like: planning and preparing a series of meals all at once. It's not a new idea, but it's recently become a fixation among people who seek good nutrition despite tight budgets and busy schedules. Not only is it an efficient (and cost-effective!) way to cook, but it lends itself to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/healthyeating/\">healthy eating</a>.

Food \"prep\" can mean a variety of things — from fully preparing each meal so it's ready to eat, to simply washing and chopping ingredients in order to streamline the cooking process. The ultimate goal on Meal Prep Sunday is to invest effort early to ensure <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/mindful-eating/\">thoughtful, healthy eating</a> later. When you prepare food <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/meal-prep-sunday/\">for the week ahead</a>, it's easier to preserve good eating habits even after the chaos of the week begins.

We have a few general guidelines for becoming a Meal Prep Sunday master, as well as an incredibly easy and delicious mini frittata recipe for healthy grab-and-go breakfasts you can make ahead of a week's worth of hectic mornings. Enjoy!

<strong>Tip #1: The Slow Cooker Is Your Meal Prep Sunday Friend</strong>

The slow cooker is the absolute perfect tool for food prep and easy dinners throughout the week. There are a few ways you can use it. The first is to find one recipe you love (like a soup or chili), press start on Sunday, and by Monday morning you'll have five lunches magically ready to go. If you don't need a ton of variety over the course of your week, this is a great way to get all of your lunches done at once.

If variety <em>is</em> important, we recommend creating \"slow cooker packs\" for dinner. Each Sunday, choose three to five slow cooker recipes that sound good to you. Simply put all of the ingredients into large freezer bags, mark the meal and the date you want it, and store in the fridge. Each morning, simply grab a bag, pour it into the slow cooker, and press start. By the time you're home from work, dinner is served! The great thing with these meal packs is that you can make a dozen or more at a time.

<strong>Tip #2: Make One-Pan Dinners Happen</strong>

If your cooking style is more spontaneous, there's no need to make full meals all at once. Simply cleaning and chopping your herbs, vegetables, and fruits can make the week ahead a breeze. Cleaning meat and prepping your seasoning ahead of time only add to the convenience. We also recommend cooking grains like quinoa and rice, or steaming starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes, in large quantities before the week begins.

One-pan dinners are the perfect way to utilize this type of prep. Since veggies will already be chopped and meats already marinated, simply spread them on a sheet pan with avocado or olive oil, and bake at 400 degrees for 20-30 minutes, depending on the specific ingredients you're using. Because your grains will already be cooked as well, simply scoop a portion onto everyone's plate and heat. <em>Voila!</em> Another option is to create \"stir fry bags\" out of your chopped veggies and meats. Just pour them into a wok for a quick, no-mess dinner.

<strong>Tip #3: Try to Get Your Vegetables at Lunch</strong>

Creating a week's worth of salads each Sunday is an excellent way to integrate a larger (and more diverse) set of vegetables and fruits into your diet. Every plant comes with its own unique composition of micronutrients; \"eating the rainbow\" throughout the week will help you cover your nutrient bases. Choose 6-12 varieties each week (or more!). On Sunday, pick a few varieties for each salad container and build interesting combinations as your base. Next, top each container with a different fat, like raw nuts or avocado. Last, choose a protein like chickpeas, quinoa, chicken, or hard boiled eggs to make your salads satiating. Half of a lemon and a tablespoon of olive oil is the perfect dressing. You can keep oil at work, or bring in mini containers to dress right before you eat so your salad doesn't get soggy.

<strong>Tip #4: Meal Prep Sunday Supercharges Breakfast  </strong>

We've all heard it before: Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. But you may find it is also the most challenging meal to find time to prepare, given how rushed we tend to be before work or school. We recommend getting 15-20 grams of protein within two hours of waking up to kick start your metabolism. One favorite Meal Prep Sunday option for breakfast is a smoothie pack. For smoothie packs, combine greens, fruit, and booster foods like chia or flax seeds in bags; then, store them in the freezer. Each morning, simply pour the contents into a blender with protein powder and your preferred liquid. Breakfast is served.

<strong>Meal Prep Sunday Recipe for Mini Frittatas</strong>

Another great option is this recipe! Any vegetables and meats can be substituted here, so feel free to create your own perfect combination.

Check out these great benefits of exercise for inspiration as you kick your efforts up a notch.

 	<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Boost Your Happiness and Self-Esteem</strong> - Finishing your morning walk, workout, or yoga class is an immediate psychological lift. Not only will your physical appearance, health, and energy improve, but the feeling of accomplishment is itself empowering and <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression#1\">boosts self-esteem</a>. Research shows that people who exercise regularly have higher levels of happiness and better overall moods than those who don’t.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keep Your Brain Sharp</strong> - As we age, <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/regular-exercise-changes-brain-improve-memory-thinking-skills-201404097110\">exercise is key to keeping our brains sharp</a>, healthy, and youthful. Studies are finding that older people who exercise regularly have significantly better cognitive health than those who do not. Regular exercise increases blood flow to the brain, and increases beneficial chemicals known as brain-derived nerve growth factors, which support brain health and prevent cognitive decline.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reduce Your Risk of Heart Disease</strong> - Regular exercise is a natural way to <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/How-to-Help-Prevent-Heart-Disease---At-Any-Age_UCM_442925_Article.jsp#.WZRi21GGPIU\">reduce your risk of heart disease</a>. In fact, a meta review study with more than 339,000 participants showed no statistically measurable differences between those individuals given medications to prevent coronary heart disease and prediabetes, and those individuals who exercised regularly. For those who had already suffered a stroke, exercise and physical activity was actually <em>more</em> effective for recovery than drug interventions.</li>
 	<li><strong>Sleep More Deeply </strong> - If you are prone to insomnia or sleep disturbances, exercise can help you sleep better. Regular exercise strengthens your <a href=\"http://sleepcenter.ucla.edu/circadian-rhythms\">circadian rhythms</a>, which gives you more energy during the daylight hours, and better quality sleep at night. That said, it can take a few months for those people just beginning an exercise routine to see a positive impact on sleep. It's important to stick with any regimen long enough to reap the benefits of exercise, when it comes to improved sleep or otherwise.</li>
 	<li><strong>Increase Energy Levels</strong> - When feeling fatigued, low-intensity exercise, such as a walk around the park, can boost energy levels up to 20 percent while decreasing exhaustion. It is important to get adequate rest on a regular basis, but a consistent exercise program also helps to improve overall energy levels.</li>
 	<li><strong>Fortify Your Immune System</strong> - Regular exercise helps protect your body from developing various cancers. There are several ways that exercise may contribute to this boost in immune system function, including the decrease of stress hormones in the body, the action of bacteria being flushed out of the upper respiratory system, and changes in antibodies and white blood cells which causes them to circulate more rapidly throughout the body.</li>
 	<li><strong>Improve Strength and Flexibility </strong>- One of the most consequential benefits of exercise is, of course, the way it builds muscles and helps your body composition. Strength training like lifting weights, and weight-bearing exercises including some kinds of yoga, help improve muscle mass and overall strength. Such workouts also <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/bone-density-and-exercise-3120770\">help prevent osteoporosis, and keep bones healthy and strong</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

These are only some of the great benefits of exercise. But you also shouldn't feel the need to overdo it when it comes to fitness. Try to incorporate a combination of vigorous and moderate aerobic exercise activities (like running, walking, cycling, or swimming), with strength training about twice per week. If your goal is to lose weight, you may need to increase your efforts at first, and then you can scale back a bit to maintain results. Always remember to check in with your doctor before beginning a new exercise program, especially if you have existing health concerns like diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis, or if you haven’t exercised in a long time.

Vaccination protects children and adults alike from a host of potentially serious, communicable illnesses. <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/32617-how-do-vaccines-work.html\">Vaccines work with your body’s immune system</a> to help develop resistance. Your vaccination requirements and recommendations may depend on your stage of life, whether you <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/travel-medicine/\">travel to various parts of the world</a>, and your profession.</p>
<strong>How Do Common Vaccines Work?</strong>

Common vaccines help to prevent illness by mimicking an infection without causing the actual disease. The immune system responds as though it were an illness, learning to recognize and fight the specific disease while it's still in a manageable form. This is what's meant by developing immunity. After receiving a vaccination, you or your child may experience minor symptoms such as fever; this is a completely normal part of the immune response. As children grow older, they may require additional doses of vaccines for further protection. Check with your primary care physician and/or pediatrician for the schedule they recommend.

<strong>Diseases Prevented by Common Vaccines</strong><strong> </strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Varicella</strong> (Chickenpox) - Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which causes a blister-like rash accompanied by itching, fever, and fatigue.</li>
 	<li><strong>Rubella </strong>(German Measles) - Rubella is a virus which often presents as a mild illness with rash, fever and sore throat, but can cause miscarriage or severe birth defects if contracted by a pregnant woman.</li>
 	<li><strong>Tetanus </strong>(Lockjaw) - Tetanus is not a human-to-human communicable disease; it is contracted through soil, manure or dust through a skin wound or puncture.</li>
 	<li><strong>Rotavirus </strong>- Rotavirus is a contagious virus that can cause gastroenteritis, which is inflammation of the stomach and intestines. Rotavirus can cause extreme dehydration and sometimes death.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pertussis</strong> (Whooping Cough) - Pertussis presents with cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, mild fever or cough. But it is also characterized by apnea, or a pause in breathing, and is particularly dangerous for babies under a year old.</li>
 	<li><strong>Polio </strong>- Polio is a crippling and often life-threatening disease. It is spread between people, and infects an individual’s brain and spinal cord, causing paralysis.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pneumococcal </strong>- Pneumococcal is an infectious disease which causes blood infections and bacterial meningitis.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mumps </strong>- Mumps is an infectious virus characterized by swollen salivary glands, fever, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite.</li>
 	<li><strong>Meningococcal</strong> - Meningococcal diseases cause infections of the brain and spinal column and can be fatal.</li>
 	<li><strong>Human Papillomavirus </strong>(HPV) - <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/preventive-exams-best-defense-against-hpv/\">HPV</a> is a strain of herpes related viruses which is a major cause of cervical and other cancers.</li>
 	<li><strong>Influenza</strong> (Flu) - The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by viruses that infect the lungs and upper respiratory tract. Cases can be mild or severe, with the worst cases potentially leading to death.</li>
 	<li><strong>Measles</strong> - Measles is a potentially life-threatening illness characterized by rash and high fever, as well as complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis, or croup.</li>
 	<li><strong>Hepatitis A </strong>- Hepatitis A is a viral, contagious liver disease which can cause mild to severe illness. It is transmitted through contact with an infected person, or through exposure to contaminated food or water.</li>
 	<li><strong>Hepatitis B </strong>- Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening virus which attacks the liver, and can cause both acute and chronic illness.</li>
 	<li><strong>Diphtheria </strong>- Diphtheria is a severe bacterial infection of the nose and throat.</li>
 	<li><strong>Haemophilus influenzae type b </strong>(Hib disease) - Hib disease is a bacterial illness which can lead to bacterial meningitis (inflammation of the brain or spinal column). It may also cause pneumonia, arthritis, or blood infections.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Common Vaccines: Side Effects and Risks</strong>

As with any medical treatment or intervention, common vaccines carry possible <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm\">risks or side effects</a>. The most frequent side effects present as mild and uncomplicated, and subside within a few days. More severe allergic reactions can occur, however, so pay close attention for the first few days after a vaccination and contact your doctor immediately if any concerns arise.

4335,8,"2017-08-23 09:00:15","2017-08-23 09:00:15","Measles is an endemic illness, meaning it is present within a population on an ongoing basis, but individuals can develop resistance to it through exposure. <a href=\"http://eheintl.com/common-vaccines\">Vaccination</a> prevents many <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/measles/index.html\">potential cases of measles</a> worldwide. Meanwhile, each year approximately 2.6 million people who have <em>not</em> had the vaccine die from the disease, also known as morbilli or rubeola. Measles symptoms tend to appear within 10 to 14 days of exposure to the virus. So what are these measles symptoms?

Signs of measles include (but are not limited to):
<ul>
 	<li>Cough</li>
 	<li>Runny nose (coryza)</li>
 	<li>Conjunctivitis (red, inflamed, and watery eyes)</li>
 	<li>High fever</li>
 	<li>Sore throat</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645467/\">Koplik’s spots</a>, which are tiny grayish-white markings on a red, inflamed background, found inside the mouth or the lining of the cheeks. These spots tend to develop two to three days after symptoms start.</li>
 	<li>A reddish-brown, blotchy skin rash which develops three to four days after symptoms start. This rash usually starts behind the ears, spreading across the head and neck, and then to the rest of the body. As the rash grows, the blotches tend to join together.</li>
 	<li>Photophobia (sensitivity to light)</li>
 	<li>Body aches</li>
</ul>
Measles symptoms characteristically develop in stages over a period of about three weeks:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>First Stage: Exposure, Infection and Incubation </strong>- During the first 10 to 14 days after infection there are no symptoms as the virus incubates.</li>
 	<li><strong>Second Stage: Symptoms Begin </strong>- For the first two to three days after symptoms start, measles will look like a mild illness with a low to moderate fever, runny nose, inflamed eyes, sore throat and persistent cough.</li>
 	<li><strong>Third Stage: Acute Stage with Rash</strong> - The face will break out first, specifically around the ears and hairline. The rash will appear as clusters of small, red spots, some of which are raised, giving an overall splotchy appearance. Over the next two to three days, the rash will spread across the rest of the body and to the legs. The fever will spike, sometimes as high as 104 to 105 F.</li>
</ul>
Measles is communicable, meaning the infected person is contagious for about eight days — from four days before the rash appears to four days after the rash has presented. The virus remains viable on an object, like a surface or a doorknob, for about two hours. Measles is contracted through physical contact with an infected person, being near infected people who sneeze or cough, or by touching an infected surface and then rubbing the eyes or nose, or putting fingers into the mouth. People who have not been infected before or vaccinated are at risk of infection if exposed to measles.

<strong>Treatment of Measles Symptoms</strong>

It's important to recognize measles symptoms early in order to limit exposure to other people and receive treatment. If there are no complications, a doctor will usually prescribe bed rest with plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Symptoms will usually subside within a week to 10 days. Keep the ill person away from school or work.

<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/complications.html\">Complications</a> are common, however, and most often develop in those individuals who have weakened immune systems or vitamin deficiencies. Young children under two years old are also more vulnerable to complications. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/complications.html\">Pregnant women who become infected</a> are at risk of miscarriage, premature delivery and low birth weight. If complications such as vomiting, difficulty breathing, respiratory tract infection, ear or eye infections, or seizures occur, see your doctor right away.

4337,8,"2017-08-25 09:30:57","2017-08-25 09:30:57","The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is a well-known <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/common-vaccines/\">vaccination</a> recommended for all children and typically administered in two parts. It can also be given to adults if they were not vaccinated during childhood. The MMR vaccine <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/measles-mumps-and-rubella-mmr-vaccine#1\">protects against the three diseases</a>, all viral, and each potentially dangerous if contracted.

<strong>Measles, Mumps, and Rubella: What to Know</strong>

Before the MMR vaccine, measles, mumps, and rubella were common diseases. Their consequences could be life-altering and even deadly.

<a href=\"https://eheintl.com/measles-symptoms/\">Symptoms of measles</a> include rash, Koplik’s spots (white spots in the mouth), runny nose, cough, and fever. Complications range from ear infections to incredibly serious conditions like pneumonia and encephalitis, which can cause brain damage.

Mumps most conspicuously causes swollen glands, as well as painful swallowing or chewing, headache, and fever. The infection’s more damaging potential complications include meningitis and deafness.

Rubella, also called German measles, can produce symptoms such as rash, mild to moderate fever, red and inflamed eyes, and swollen lymph nodes at the back of the neck. It can cause severe complications for pregnant women, including birth defects and miscarriage.

<strong>Who Should Get the MMR Vaccine?</strong>

According to the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmr-vaccine.html\">CDC</a>), the MMR vaccine is best administered as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>The first dose for children aged 12 to 15 months.</li>
 	<li>The second dose at four to six years old.</li>
 	<li>Adults 18 years of age or older, and born after 1956, should receive one dose of the vaccine, <em>unless</em> they have had all three illnesses previously, <em>or</em> have already been vaccinated.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Who Should Not Get the MMR Vaccine (or Wait)?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Individuals who have had previous allergic reactions to the MMR vaccine.</li>
 	<li>Individuals who are allergic to the antibiotic neomycin or another component of the MMR vaccine.</li>
 	<li>Individuals with an immune system disorder, including HIV/AIDS.</li>
 	<li>Individuals with cancer, and those undergoing cancer treatment.</li>
 	<li>Individuals taking medications that interfere with the immune system, such as steroids.</li>
</ul>
Moreover, you should consider <em>delaying</em> the MMR vaccine if you are pregnant, currently experiencing an illness, have recently received a blood transfusion, or have already received a vaccine within the last four weeks.

<strong>Possible MMR Vaccine Side Effects</strong>

According to the CDC, the MMR vaccine is “much safer than getting measles, mumps, or rubella.” That said, you should be aware of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm\">possible side effects</a>, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Fever and/or mild rash (minor)</li>
 	<li>Pain and stiffness of the joints, low platelet count, or seizure (moderate)</li>
 	<li>Allergic reaction (most severe)</li>
</ul>
The CDC reports that approximately one in six children develops a fever following the MMR vaccination, while febrile seizures take place at a rate of roughly one in 3,000 doses. Doctors emphasize that the benefits of immunization outweigh the potential risks, as vaccinations are safe for most people and critical to the prevention of measles, mumps, and rubella outbreaks.

<strong>MMR Vaccine and Autism</strong>

The MMR vaccine was introduced in the United States in 1971. Some people have raised concerns that the vaccine may precipitate severe health risks in children, including autism and inflammatory bowel disease. Research has shown, however, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html\">no link between these conditions</a> and the MMR vaccine. Much of the controversy was fueled by a study published in <em>The Lancet</em> in 1998 but subsequently retracted.

<strong>Final Thoughts</strong>

Allergies to vaccines are rare, but, as with any medical intervention, reactions or side effects are possible. Always discuss your specific medical concerns and history with your doctor, and be sure to ask about potential risks for any treatment under consideration.

Of course, major lifestyle factors like tanning and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/quick_thought_smoking_cessation/\">smoking</a> will sabotage your skin (and your health) no matter what you eat, so kick those habits to the curb first. But when you upgrade your diet, your skin can clear up, look younger, and have improved structural integrity. What are the best foods for skin that glows?
<ol>
 	<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Carrots</strong> - Carrots are little powerhouses full of vitamin A and beta-carotene, which help clear up acne and breakouts. Vitamin A is an antioxidant which inhibits overproduction of skin cells, which can lead to clogged pores and blemishes. The vitamin also plays a role in preventing the development of skin cancer, and accelerates cell turnover, promoting healthy skin and a youthful complexion. While carrots are perhaps best-known as a good food for eyesight, they're also among the best foods for skin.</li>
 	<li><strong>Walnuts</strong> - Consuming just five grams of polyunsaturated fats each day lowers your risk of skin cancer. One daily serving of walnuts provides more than twice that amount. <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/omega-3-fatty-acids-fish-oil-alpha-linolenic-acid/background/hrb-20059372\">Alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fat</a> found in walnuts, is a powerful component of the lubricating layer of the skin, keeping it moist and supple.</li>
 	<li><strong>Almonds </strong>- Almonds are rich in <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-vitamin-e#1\">vitamin E</a>, one of the most important antioxidants for skin health. It also keeps skin moisturized, helps repair damaged cells, and protects against sun damage. Almonds are also one of the best sources for dairy-free calcium.</li>
 	<li><strong>Green Tea </strong>- Green tea is a powerful source of catechins, which have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. Drinking <a href=\"http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/benefits-one-two-cups-green-tea-5822.html\">two cups of green tea per day</a> helps prevent skin cancer and reduces signs of sun damage. Just be aware that too much caffeine has a dehydrating effect on the skin, so moderate your consumption.</li>
 	<li><strong>Kale</strong> - This cruciferous veggie is a super-rich source of vitamins A, C, and E, and also <a href=\"http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-K\">vitamin K</a> — all key antioxidants for skin health and radiance. Vitamin K also helps with proper blood clotting and faster healing. For easy ways to get one of the best foods for skin, you can simply throw some kale into a fruit smoothie, or try some roasted kale chips as an alternative to potato chips.</li>
 	<li><strong>Papaya</strong> - This tropical fruit is full of active enzymes, such as chymopapain, which are powerful tools for the prevention and relief of inflammation. Another enzyme in papaya is <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/the-benefits-of-papain-89493\">papain</a>, which heals blemishes and treats acne when applied topically, as it helps clear pores and cleanse the skin. Just one cup of ripe papaya provides you with 140 percent of your daily recommended amount of collagen-supporting vitamin C.</li>
 	<li><strong>Turmeric </strong>- This spice’s primary antioxidant, curcumin, has been shown to be one of the most powerful anti-inflammatory and free radical-fighting compounds. Turmeric is also protective against cancer, and facilitates pain reduction. Topical applications of turmeric can also help lighten scars and hyperpigmentation. Try this easy, homemade, and <a href=\"https://www.liveabout.com/skin-brightening-turmeric-face-mask-346531\">healing turmeric facial mask</a> to promote a more even skin tone.</li>
 	<li><strong>Tomatoes </strong>- High in lycopene, tomatoes are amazing for helping to prevent sun damage and premature aging. Research shows that lycopene is a powerful protectant against sunburn. It also promotes and strengthens collagen, and reduces fine lines and wrinkles. Tomatoes are a versatile addition to any diet of the best foods for skin.</li>
 	<li><strong>Berries</strong> - High in vitamin C, phytonutrients, and antioxidants that fight free radicals and support collagen production, berries are amazing and delicious skin-positive foods. <a href=\"https://www.wildblueberries.com/health-research/antioxidants/\">Blueberries</a> are especially high in antioxidants, while strawberries are particularly rich in vitamin C. Regular consumption of berries helps keep your skin smooth, strong, and firm.</li>
 	<li><strong>Eggs </strong>- Studies show that zeaxanthin and lutein, two antioxidants found in eggs, can more than quadruple protection against ultraviolet (UV) damage leading to hyperpigmentation, lines, and skin cancer. These antioxidants also promote firm, soft, and hydrated skin.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
The best foods for skin are foods with a wealth of overall nutritional value. There is no substitute for the right diet in maintaining beautiful and radiant skin. Topical approaches to skin care can do a lot of good, but the most powerful transformation comes from what you put <em>into</em> your body. Stay hydrated with pure water, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/always-wear-sunscreen/\">apply sunscreen daily</a>, and incorporate these glow-promoting foods into your regular meal and snack rotation.

4413,8,"2017-09-05 15:00:36","2017-09-05 15:00:36","September is National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer in <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/considering_mens_health/\">American men</a>, and is the most common non-skin cancer. While there are more aggressive forms, most prostate cancers <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/home/ovc-20317957\">progress slowly and respond to treatment</a>. This means early detection is key. Being aware of the risk factors for prostate cancer, the disease's symptoms, and relevant lifestyle adjustments and treatments, is crucial to avoiding the illness or mitigating its severity.

<strong>Prostate Cancer Risk Factors</strong>

There is no way to know for sure if you will get prostate cancer, but awareness of potential risks is important. Notable risk factors include:
<ul>
 	<li><em>Genetic mutations and family history</em> — A family history of prostate cancer, particularly if a father or brother had the disease, may indicate a genetic vulnerability. Men whose families have the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations may be at increased risk.</li>
 	<li><em>Diet and lifestyle</em> — A sedentary lifestyle may contribute to the risk for developing prostate cancer, as may a diet high in dairy products and red meat. These factors also have an effect on outcomes once the illness has already developed.</li>
 	<li><em>Chemical exposures</em> — Men who have been exposed to a range of chemicals, including Agent Orange during the Vietnam war, substances associated with firefighting, and the <a href=\"https://www.niehs.nih.gov/news/newsletter/2014/4/science-bpaprostate/\">Bisphenol A (BPA)</a> found in many consumer goods, may be at an elevated risk.</li>
 	<li><em>Advanced age</em> — The disease is most common in men over the age of 65.</li>
 	<li><em>Ethnicity</em> — African-American men develop prostate cancer at a higher rate than other U.S. sub-populations. Also, the illness is most commonly found in North America, Australia, northwestern Europe, and the Caribbean.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Prostate Cancer Signs and Symptoms</strong>

Men can present with different symptoms of prostate cancer; some have none at all. But the most common signs of the illness include:
<ul>
 	<li>Frequent urination, particularly at night.</li>
 	<li>Difficulty starting urination, or a weak or interrupted flow.</li>
 	<li>Pain or burning during urination.</li>
 	<li>Blood in the semen or urine.</li>
 	<li>Painful ejaculation.</li>
 	<li>Difficulty fully emptying the bladder.</li>
 	<li>Persistent pain in the hips, pelvis, or back.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Benefits of Prostate Cancer Screenings</strong>

There are two tests typically used to detect the cancer:
<ul>
 	<li>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test — This screening method measures the amount of PSA (a substance produced by the prostate) in the blood, as these levels tend to be higher in men with prostate cancer. These levels can also be elevated due to other prostate conditions. The PSA can detect cancer earlier than no screening at all, but false positive and negative results do occur with this test. Your doctor can help you determine if this method is right for you.</li>
 	<li>Digital rectal examination (DRE) — A nurse or physician gently inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to check the prostate gland for abnormalities, lumps, or growths. The clinician may also gently press down on the lower abdomen or pelvic area during the exam.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Preventive Care, Diet, and Lifestyle Recommendations</strong>

Approaching your prostate health with a preventive mindset is the best way to reduce your risk for cancer. Here are some things to consider:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-exercise/\"><em>Exercise and maintain a healthy weight</em></a> — Having a regular fitness routine, even if it's just going for brisk walks, is a great way to optimize your health. Obesity has a negative impact on survival outcomes for those diagnosed with prostate cancer. Keeping your weight in a healthy range is an important component of preventive prostate care.</li>
 	<li><em><a href=\"https://eheintl.com/manage_your_stress_with_these_techniques/\">Manage stress</a></em> — Proper stress management is a powerful preventive measure for a range of medical issues, and studies have shown that men who practice stress management techniques before and after prostate cancer treatment have a higher quality of life while recovering. <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-meditation/\">Meditate</a>, practice deep belly breathing, and find ways to do what you love. Work and hobbies that promote serenity and relaxation are key. Also be mindful of your stress load at work, and reduce and manage it as much as possible.</li>
 	<li><em>Maintain a healthy diet</em> — Choose a <a href=\"http://yumuniverse.com/how-to-start-a-plant-based-diet/\">plant-based diet</a> low in red meat and dairy, and high in leafy greens, fruits and vegetables, good fats (omega-3s), and antioxidants. Some foods particularly helpful for prostate cancer prevention and recovery may be fatty fish, tomatoes cooked in olive oil, green tea, and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cabbage.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Additional Resources </strong>

September is a great time to talk with your doctor and preventive care providers about prostate cancer. The more informed you are, the better you'll be able to make the best decisions for your prostate health. When detected early, the illness is treatable and survivable. Understanding the disease and taking a proactive approach will make all the difference. See the following resources for additional information:

While simply having one or more of the factors does <em>not</em> guarantee you will get prostate cancer, you can reduce the risk by <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/prostate-cancer/\">understanding the disease</a> and then <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/in-depth/prostate-cancer-prevention/ART-20045641\">adjusting your lifestyle</a> to take some measure of control over your vulnerability.

The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072475/\">prostate</a> is part of the male reproductive system, and prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer for men. One in eight men will be diagnosed in his lifetime. While only one in 10,000 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 40, one in 39 will be diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 59, and one in 14 will be diagnosed between the ages of 60 and 69. About 60 percent of all prostate cancers are diagnosed in men over the age of 65. The disease is treatable if it's detected early, so consult with your physician about proper screening. Researchers have identified a number of prostate cancer risk factors that may affect a man’s chances of developing the illness:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Age —</strong> As discussed above, prostate cancer occurs at higher rates as men get older; while the disease can affect men in their twenties and thirties, it is far more likely to develop in those who have reached middle age.</li>
 	<li><strong>Family History —</strong> While most prostate cancers occur in men with no family history of the illness, heredity does play a role. Having a father or a brother with prostate cancer more than doubles a man’s chances of developing the illness. The risk increases if several relatives have had the illness.</li>
 	<li><strong>Geography</strong> — Prostate cancer is most common in North America, northwestern Europe, the Caribbean, and Australia. Lifestyle and dietary factors may contribute to the risks being higher in these regions, but more research is needed.</li>
 	<li><strong>Genetic Factors</strong> — Beyond family history, prostate cancer risk factors include a genetic component. Men with Lynch syndrome, which is a form of hereditary colorectal cancer, may have a slightly raised risk for prostate cancer. The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3720154/\">BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations</a> (which raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancers for women) may also increase the chances of developing prostate cancer in men.</li>
 	<li><strong>Chemical Exposures</strong> — Studies suggest that exposure to different chemicals (ranging from those used in firefighting and warfare to the BPA found in many plastic consumer products) my increase the risk of developing prostate and other cancers.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ethnicity —</strong> Prostate cancer occurs more often in men of African descent than in men of other ethnic groups, and it occurs less often in Latino and Asian-American men than in non-Hispanic whites.</li>
</ul>

Other prostate cancer risk factors are related to social and environmental considerations, particularly <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/features/is-there-prostate-cancer-diet\">diet and lifestyle</a>. While there is no conclusive evidence that obesity is a causative factor, it does have a negative impact on prostate cancer outcomes. The same is true of smoking. There is also evidence that men whose diets are high in red meat and dairy — and low in fresh fruits and vegetables, particularly cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cabbage — are at higher risk for developing prostate cancer.

There are some additional prostate cancer risk factors related to the more aggressive form of the disease. These include: sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise, excessive calcium intake, and tall height.

<strong>Lifestyle Adjustments to Reduce Your Prostate Cancer Risk</strong>

Lifestyle choices that boost your overall health are helpful in preventing many chronic conditions and cancers. Targeted adjustments that increase your chances of avoiding or recovering from prostate cancer include:
<ul>
 	<li>Avoiding excessive calorie intake, along with exercise (walking is particularly good), and maintaining a healthy weight.</li>
 	<li>Eating a <a href=\"https://zerocancer.org/learn/current-patients/maintain-qol/diet-and-nutrition/\">plant-based diet</a> that emphasizes fresh fruits and vegetables, and minimizes animal products (especially red meat and dairy). Particularly helpful foods include cooked tomatoes, olive oil, fatty fish, green tea, small amounts of soy, and cruciferous vegetables.</li>
 	<li>Limiting your intake of simple and refined sugars.</li>
 	<li>Avoiding smoking, and limiting or eliminating alcohol intake.</li>
 	<li>Reducing and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/symptoms-of-stress/\">managing your stress</a> at home and at work. Seek treatment for depression, hypertension, and diabetes.</li>
 	<li>Keeping cholesterol levels healthy.</li>
</ul>
Lifestyle factors such as diet and stress management are important, but it is also crucial to receive proper screenings to detect the illness early when it is easiest to treat. There are competing medical recommendations about when (and how often) to get screened. Be sure to talk to your doctor, who can advise you regarding the risks and benefits of prostate screening procedures based on your specific profile and can help guide any preventive lifestyle adjustments you may need to make.

4425,8,"2017-08-30 19:58:29","2017-08-30 19:58:29","Tropical Storm Harvey continues to devastate the Gulf Coast, with record rainfall still pounding the region. Millions of Americans in Houston and countless small towns across Texas and Louisiana are now facing destructive, deadly flooding.

EHE's thoughts are with everyone affected by the storm and its aftermath. We have a clinic and affiliated physicians in Houston, as well as family, friends, colleagues, and clients throughout the area. While a catastrophe like Harvey creates emergencies that make personal care incredibly difficult, it's never more important than during a disaster to follow basic medical protocols to ensure your safety.

<strong>Please read the following EHE recommendations for staying healthy in the wake of the storm</strong>.

<strong>Hygiene and Drinking Water</strong>

While basic hygiene is always important, it's especially vital during floods when floodwaters can carry sewage, pesticides, and other highly dangerous substances. Be sure to wash your hands and face with water that's been boiled or disinfected to reduce your exposure to germs. Similarly, if your community's tap water has been contaminated or compromised, only use properly cleaned water to drink, prepare food, or brush your teeth. See the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/drinking/making-water-safe.html\"><strong>Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) recommendations for making water safe in an emergency</strong></a>.

<strong>Infectious Disease</strong>

While new outbreaks of diseases <em>not</em> common in the United States (such as cholera or typhoid) will not occur after Harvey or similar storms, other communicable illnesses like diarrhea and respiratory illnesses may spread due to compromised public sanitation, crowding in shelters, and other factors. Pay attention to specific alerts from local and state health departments. Most importantly, do everything possible to maintain personal hygiene and the integrity of your food and water. The CDC also advises people in post-hurricane flood zones to be careful to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/facts.html\"><strong>protect against mosquitoes</strong></a> since the insects can carry a number of diseases and thrive in standing water. Here is additional information on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/infectious.html\"><strong>specific infectious diseases</strong></a> associated with natural disasters.

<strong>Tetanus</strong>

Floodwaters can contain debris that may cause cuts or puncture wounds and those same waters could be contaminated with bacteria which is why there is a heightened media focus on the risk of contracting tetanus however, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/08/29/tetanus-houston-floods/\"><strong>infectious disease experts caution <em>against</em> public panic regarding tetanus</strong></a>. While tetanus infection is serious, mere exposure to floodwaters is NOT in and of itself a reason to get an immediate tetanus booster shot, despite certain reports. If you sustain a wound during a flood, it should be evaluated for possible tetanus treatment no differently than it would be in a non-disaster situation. If you've already been vaccinated on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/tetanus.html\"><strong>CDC-recommended schedule</strong></a> (a booster shot every 10 years for adults), no additional vaccination is necessary. In most cases, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/facts.html\"><strong>properly treating wounds</strong></a> and consulting with a doctor if you are not sure of your tetanus vaccination history should be the guiding protocol.

<strong>Safety When Reentering Your House</strong>

If your home is flooded, it is imperative to take <em>extreme caution</em> when you return. All utilities — electricity, natural gas, propane, etc. — must be shut off to avoid potential electrocution or explosion. Depending on the extent of the flooding, dangerous downed power lines may be obscured, sewage or metal debris could be in the water, ventilation of carbon monoxide could be blocked, and other hazards could be present. Always consult with the police and fire departments, as well as local utility providers, to determine whether it's safe to enter the house. For more information, see <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/mold/reenter.html\"><strong>CDC guidelines on reentering flooded homes</strong></a> and additional <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/floods/after.html\"><strong>cleanup recommendations</strong></a>.

<strong>Mold</strong>

A major health risk in the coming weeks and months will be the mold in buildings hit by rain and flooding. Experts say that any structure flooded during an event on this scale should be presumed to contain mold if not thoroughly dried within 48 hours. Given the prolonged nature of this storm, the mold issue could be particularly widespread. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/floods.pdf\"><strong>recommendations for residential flood cleanup</strong></a>, and the CDC has a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/pdf/flyer-get-rid-of-mold.pdf\"><strong>checklist of the first and most important steps to take to combat flood-related mold</strong></a>. A comprehensive and more detailed guide to mold from both agencies can be <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mold/cleanup.htm\"><strong>seen here</strong></a>.

<strong>Mental Health</strong>

Natural disasters trigger spikes in stress and anxiety, can worsen existing mental health problems, and often impede standard mental health care delivery. If you are experiencing emotional distress due to the storm and need help, contact the <strong>National Disaster Distress Helpline</strong>. It is multilingual, critical crisis support, available toll-free and 24 hours a day via phone (1-800-985-5990) and SMS (text ‘TalkWithUs’ to 66746). For more help in coping with the trauma caused by emergencies like Harvey, <a href=\"https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/harvey2017/Pages/mental-health.aspx\"><strong>see these mental health resources at the Department of Health and Human Services</strong></a>.

<strong>Animals</strong>

With floodwaters disrupting the environment and displacing species of every kind, there are widespread reports (and social media documentation) of fire ants, snakes, alligators surfacing in areas in and around Houston where they’re usually not spotted. Wildlife experts advise people to exercise the same common sense they would in normal circumstances: Stay clear, even if the animals don’t seem dangerous. Be especially vigilant, given how floodwaters can keep animals hidden until they’re very close. And, when reentering your home after it’s safe, be sure to check for any animals that may have taken up residence amid the storm.

Your EHE clinical exam is convenient and comprehensive. The process is designed to give enrollees unparalleled insight into their health, as well as a well-defined path toward improvement. Here’s an overview of what to expect.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Before Your Appointment</strong>

Once you are enrolled as an eligible patient and added to the EHE system, you will receive an email explaining how to complete your online EHE + Me profile (including medical history) and schedule your exam. A week before your visit, EHE will send an appointment reminder and any relevant preparation instructions.

&nbsp;

<strong>Day of Exam</strong>

After checking in at reception, you will have an entrance <strong>interview</strong> with an EHE clinician, who will review exactly which tests and screenings are scheduled and answer any questions. With first-time visitors, we go into more detail to ensure every aspect of the clinical experience is understood.

The next step is typically <strong>laboratory testing</strong>, followed by <strong>screening procedures</strong>, and then your <strong>physical exam</strong> and conversation with the doctor. The EHE physician will discuss the results of your screenings, family history, specific concerns, and aspects of your routines and lifestyle. For returning patients, the doctor may review notable trends or changes since previous visits.

The visit ends with a brief exit interview, during which a clinician answers any follow-up questions and facilitates potential post-exam care. You will receive a report with your exam results within 10 business days.

&nbsp;

<strong>Exam Components </strong>

EHE exams are always tailored to your specific needs (in terms of gender, age, special medical considerations, etc.), but a standard clinical screening protocol guides the process for all enrollees, whether they’re seen at an EHE clinic or by an affiliated doctor in the EHE physicians network.

The standard <strong>clinical screening protocol</strong> includes (but is not limited to) these components:
<ul>
 	<li>Comprehensive physical exam</li>
 	<li>Electrocardiogram (EKG)</li>
 	<li>Body composition assessment (including Body Mass Index)</li>
 	<li>Vision screening</li>
 	<li>Hearing test</li>
 	<li>Pulmonary function test (spirometry)</li>
 	<li>Pelvic exam with Pap smear (for women)</li>
 	<li>Laboratory testing &amp; analysis (<em>see below</em>)</li>
</ul>
Additional <strong>age-determined screening procedures</strong> include:

Cardiac stress test every three years for patients 40-49, every other year for patients over 50
<ul>
 	<li>Mammography for women over 40</li>
 	<li>Colonoscopy for patients over 40</li>
 	<li>Vascular health screening every other year</li>
</ul>
Standard <strong>laboratory testing</strong> includes:
<ul>
 	<li>Complete blood count (CBC) with differential &amp; platelets
<ul>
 	<li>Screening for anemia, leukemia, inflammation, infection, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Comprehensive metabolic panel (glucose, kidney function, electrolytes, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Liver function</li>
 	<li>Lipid panel</li>
 	<li>Iron and total iron binding capacity (TIBC)</li>
 	<li>Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</li>
 	<li>Blood type (first visit only)</li>
 	<li>25-hydroxy Vitamin D test</li>
 	<li>Complete urinalysis</li>
 	<li>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for males over 40</li>
 	<li>Cardio C Reactive Protein for patients over 40</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Comprehensive Consultation</strong>

The EHE visit will also include discussion of broader issues pertaining to lifestyle. The clinician will ask you about your tobacco and alcohol consumption, eating and exercise habits, and other aspects of your health that may be areas of focus for post-exam care. This consultation also engages diet and nutrition, stress/anxiety/depression, relevant sexual health screenings for men and women, immunization recommendations, and other concerns.","Comprehensive Health Exam","","publish","closed","closed","","comprehensive-health-exam","","","2017-09-13 21:44:15","2017-09-13 21:44:15","",0,"https://eheintl.com/?page_id=4468",0,"page","",0

EHE care begins with the exam. But you have the opportunity to make that initial visit just the starting point — not the end — of their journey to improved health. <strong>Post-exam care</strong> is available to all EHE enrollees. Those who take advantage are in the best position to make meaningful, lasting progress toward healthier lives. Here’s an overview of what to expect with your post-exam care.

&nbsp;

<strong>Your Exam Report: What Does It Mean?</strong>

Post-exam care is activated after you’ve completed your EHE exam and received your report. There are three general report classifications: <em>normal findings</em>, <em>health risks</em>, and <em>significant findings</em>.

Only a small percentage of patients (about 1%) fall into the <em>normal findings</em> category. In these cases of near-optimal health, there is no specific need for EHE to engage you for additional care. Your records stay in the system for future physical exams and reference by your primary care physician.

You are more likely to be among the majority of enrollees whose reports include <em>health risks</em>. For these individuals, testing signals one or multiple warning signs. These indicators could be blood pressure or cholesterol that falls outside the healthy range, elevated stress measures, pre-diabetic glucose levels, poor eating or lifestyle habits, etc. If you have health risks, you are a prime candidate for <strong>personal health coaching</strong> (<em>see below</em>).

Your report could also show <em>significant findings</em>, in which case you need to take active measures to avoid health problems. There could be mammogram or colonoscopy or EKG abnormalities, severely high cholesterol, or a variety of other screening results requiring medical attention. Please know that while these findings are significant, they are <em>not</em> unusual. Roughly half of EHE enrollees are in this category, and those who pursue post-exam care via <strong>clinical intervention</strong> and/or <strong>referral coordination</strong> (<em>see below</em>) are better able to address issues before they become more serious.

&nbsp;

<strong>Personal Health Coaching</strong>

An incredibly effective, convenient, and flexible service, especially useful if your exam report identified <em>health risks</em>. EHE has credentialed health coaches, educators, and nutritionists whose collective expertise covers virtually any identified risk. Focal points of coaching include physical activity, nutrition, weight management, stress management, prediabetes management, and smoking cessation.

Personal health coaches:
<ul>
 	<li>Work with you for a <strong>full year</strong> after the EHE exam at <strong>no additional charge</strong> — it’s built into the program for anyone who wants it</li>
 	<li>Coach remotely by telephone, so it’s available no matter where you live, at times that are convenient</li>
</ul>
The initial session is called a “goals call,” during which you establish what you want to work on, identifying past challenges and current motivations. Coaching can focus on one area or many areas — it’s entirely up to you. The entire process is patient-centric and designed to be encouraging, non-threatening, open, and flexible. Follow-up sessions are usually 15 to 20 minutes long and can be done on whatever schedule/frequency works best for you.

&nbsp;

<strong>Clinical Intervention</strong>

If your exam shows <em>significant findings</em>, an EHE clinical intervention nurse will contact you shortly after receiving the report. During that first point of contact, the nurse makes sure you understand the situation and are aware of next medical options and recommendations. EHE attempts to smooth your path — both in terms of understanding the health concern, and in getting access to primary care physicians and specialists.

EHE will contact you six months later to see if there’s been follow-up on recommendations pertaining to the specific issue(s). The goal is to remove any obstacles preventing you from getting the targeted medical attention you need.

There is <strong>no additional charge for a full year</strong> after the EHE exam for any clinical intervention services.

EHE also provides travel medicine consultation if you are planning to travel overseas. An EHE nurse serves as the initial contact and can connect you with a provider, either at one of EHE’s locations or in the EHE physicians network. You can also reach out to EHE for travel medicine recommendations separately from any existing clinical intervention process.

&nbsp;

<strong>Referral Coordination</strong>

If you have significant exam findings or otherwise need assistance getting set up with a primary care physician or specialist, EHE offers referral coordination based on your existing insurance.

EHE can help you establish contact with doctors (and transfer medical records, make a first appointment, etc.) in any geographic area, focusing on physicians with reasonable availability who meet EHE’s standards of quality care. You can also request referrals on your own through the secure EHE + Me portal. The site also lets you have access to your medical records for use whenever you need them.

 	<li><strong>Go Smoke-Free</strong> — Encourage and incentivize smoking cessation in the workplace. Organize a challenge for those employees who need to quit, and award bonuses for progress. Adhere to a strict no-smoking policy, and provide smoking cessation support programs for workers.</li>
 	<li><strong>Create Fitness Challenges </strong>— Some healthy (wellness-oriented) competition can be fun and motivating for employers and employees alike. Physical fitness reduces the risk of chronic illnesses and lowers stress, and some friendly games with colleagues supports team building while boosting morale.</li>
 	<li><strong>Implement Fitness Programs </strong>— Subsidized gym memberships and yoga classes, weight loss competitions, walking meetings, and charity walks and marathons, are just some great options to get your team moving. Offer incentives to encourage your employees to participate; whether it’s a prize, bonus, or morning off, there are many ways to inexpensively reward participation.</li>
 	<li><strong>Encourage Flexible Schedules</strong> — Offering remote work days, and allowing employees to set their own schedules (when possible) is a powerful way to reduce workplace stress. Studies show that more flex time increases employee satisfaction, and increases overall productivity.</li>
 	<li><strong>Allow Pets at Work</strong> — Barring any allergies, this is a great way to reduce stress and increase morale and positivity in the workplace. If space or employee volume is an issue, create a rotating schedule allowing employees to bring their companion animals to work on a given day.</li>
 	<li><strong>Implement Break Times </strong>— Encourage stretch breaks, as well as walking breaks outdoors. Movement breaks are vital for stress relief and rest throughout the day. Moreover, getting up and moving encourages better cardiovascular health, lessening the risk of blood clots and heart disease.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bring (Real) Plants to the Office</strong> — The increased oxygen provided by plants increases air quality, and studies show that having plants in the workplace increases productivity, and reduces absenteeism. Plants also create a more pleasant and welcoming work environment.</li>
 	<li><strong>Encourage Employee Vacations</strong> — Taking regular time off reduces stress and increases productivity. Studies show that vacations also help prevent heart disease. Time away lets employees recharge and rest, returning to the workplace with renewed energy and focus.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Invest in a Healthy Workforce</strong>

A healthy workforce is an investment that improves your bottom line, while giving vital support to the team responsible for the company's success. Creating a great work culture of wellness nurtures and sustains vigorous, productive, and innovative employees. And as outlined above, such an investment doesn't need to be an expensive one; there are many simple, effective ways to encourage a healthy workforce.

4531,8,"2017-09-13 16:20:08","2017-09-13 16:20:08","Posture refers to how your body is positioned when sitting or standing, as well as its alignment when you are lying down. Often, we are only aware of our posture when we're engaged in an <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/what_are_the_types_of_yoga/\">activity like yoga</a> that requires attention to specific positioning. But <a href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20446224,00.html\">healthy posture</a> throughout the day is critical to limiting stress on ligaments, muscles, and tendons. Poor posture can lead to chronic pain and may increase your chance of injury. Good posture places the body in correct alignment so stress is properly distributed across muscles and ligaments. When this alignment is as it should be, the muscles work more efficiently and as intended, reducing wear and tear on the joints. Healthy posture decreases the risk of osteoarthritis and various stress-related injuries, and improves balance and bodily stability.

<strong>Benefits of Good Posture</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Facilitates better breathing by opening up the lungs.</li>
 	<li>Decreases stress on the ligaments holding spinal joints in place.</li>
 	<li>Keeps the spine in proper alignment.</li>
 	<li>Keeps joints and bones from becoming set in abnormal positions, ensuring muscles are used correctly.</li>
 	<li>Decreases wear and tear on joint surfaces.</li>
 	<li>Maximizes energy and decreases fatigue; when muscles are being used efficiently, the body expends less effort.</li>
 	<li>Prevents backache and chronic muscle pain.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to Achieve Good Posture</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Shoulders should be even; roll shoulders up, then back and down — the collar bones should feel open.</li>
 	<li>Chin should be parallel to the floor.</li>
 	<li>Keep your spine in a neutral position; do not over flex or arch the back.</li>
 	<li>Abdominal muscles are braced.</li>
 	<li>Hips are even.</li>
 	<li>Let arms fall to your sides with your elbows even.</li>
 	<li>Knees are even and facing forward.</li>
 	<li>Body weight should be equally distributed on both feet.</li>
 	<li>Neck ought to be straight — not too far forward or too far back. You can check your profile in a mirror to see if your head and neck are in good alignment.</li>
 	<li>When sitting, keep shoulders in correct alignment, chin parallel to the floor, and hips and knees facing forward.</li>
</ul>
You can achieve better posture with some simple, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/07/five-best-posture-exercises\">targeted exercises</a>. The goal is to increase core strength and flexibility. Utilizing balance-specific exercises that address posture will facilitate improvements you will begin to feel in just a few weeks.

<strong>Habits that Contribute to Poor Posture</strong><strong> </strong>

Now that you know why it’s important to build and maintain good posture, let’s look at some habits that may be sabotaging your efforts:
<ul>
 	<li>Poor work <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/office-ergonomics/art-20046169\">ergonomics</a>. If your desk or chair is not at the right height for your body, it can contribute to poor posture. It’s a good idea to have an ergonomics expert analyze your work setup to ensure it’s right for you.</li>
 	<li>Too little activity and a sedentary lifestyle. If you’re sitting at your desk all day, with no fitness or walking breaks, that increases your chances of developing poor posture. Be sure to make the time for exercise or activity of some kind. Movement also decreases compression on your spine, which is exacerbated by prolonged sitting. Spinal compression is a contributing factor to poor posture.</li>
 	<li>Imbalanced fitness training. It is important to exercise in a way that emphasizes balanced strength and development throughout the body. Be sure to strengthen the back, and, if necessary, consult with a trainer to design a workout that will emphasize proper alignment and strength training.</li>
</ul>
<strong>A Good Posture Visualization Exercise and Final Thoughts</strong>

One visualization that can help you maintain good posture is to imagine a string starting in your heels, going all the way up through your legs and spine, and then up and out through the top of your head. If someone were to pull the string from the top of your head, that gives you a sense of how you should stand and align your body. When you are in a sitting position, imagine the string starting at your tailbone, and being pulled from there up through the top of your head. Sit upright, breathe, and open your chest.

Being mindful of your posture is not difficult, but it may take a little practice. Set a reminder or <a href=\"http://www.refinery29.com/posture-apps\">app</a> on your phone that helps you remember to monitor your alignment throughout the day. Stay active and fit, and be sure that your exercise program is alignment-friendly, developing balanced strength and flexibility throughout the body.

4539,8,"2017-09-15 10:00:15","2017-09-15 10:00:15","Snacking during the workday can sabotage otherwise healthy habits if you aren’t careful. When mid-day energy crashes or <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/preventing-workplace-stress/\">stress hits at work</a>, it can be all too easy to reach for a candy bar or some chips from the vending machine. But snacking doesn’t have to be detrimental. Healthy snacks can sustain your energy between meals much more effectively than a quick sugar fix. Here are some ideas to make <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jacquelyn-smith/the-best-16-snacks-to-eat-at-your-desk.html\">office snacking</a> nutritious while still delicious.

<strong>Ideas for Healthy Snacks at Work</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Rice Crackers and Almond Butter</strong> — Slather whole grain rice crackers with raw or lightly toasted almond butter for healthy fat, protein, and whole grain carbs sure to satisfy your hunger.</li>
 	<li><strong>Dark Chocolate Squares —</strong> If you have a sweet tooth, try a square (or more) of dark chocolate. Opt for varieties that are 70 percent cacao or higher in order to limit the amount of added sugars.</li>
 	<li><strong>Fresh Fruit —</strong> Keep apples, bananas, or fresh berries at your desk for some natural sweetness that is loaded with the healthy fiber, vitamins, and nutrients your body needs.</li>
 	<li><strong>Nuts and Seeds —</strong> Almonds, sunflower seeds, walnuts, Brazil nuts, or pistachios are all good choices. Nuts and seeds are great sources of protein and healthy fats, and they also happen to be delicious with a little dark chocolate.</li>
 	<li><strong>Dried Fruit —</strong> Try some apricots, raisins, dried cranberries, cherries, or banana chips, and stick to unsulfured varieties with no added sugars. You can make a quick, DIY trail mix by adding in your favorite nuts, seeds, and dark chocolate chips.</li>
 	<li><strong>Healthy Snack Bars —</strong> There are many options, but look for brands like <a href=\"http://www.larabar.com/\">Lara Bars</a> or <a href=\"https://www.kindsnacks.com/\">Kind Bars</a> that contain natural ingredients and little or no added sugars.</li>
 	<li><strong>Seaweed Snacks</strong> — Snacks like <a href=\"http://www.seasnax.com/\">Seasnax</a> are a great alternative to chips when you want something a little savory that is still high in nutritional value.</li>
 	<li><strong>Kale Chips —</strong> Another great alternative to typical vending machine chips, kale chips are now sold at most grocery stores and are also easy to make at home, using recipes like <a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/kale-chips-51186450\">this one</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Apples and Nut Butter —</strong> Try sliced apples with your favorite nut butter; you can also add a sprinkle of cinnamon and a drizzle of raw honey.</li>
 	<li><strong>Almonds and Dates —</strong> The sweetness of the dates will curb your afternoon sugar cravings, and almonds provide healthy fat and protein.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vegetables and Hummus —</strong> Slice up some carrots, red peppers, broccoli, and cauliflower, and enjoy the veggies with your favorite store-bought or homemade hummus.</li>
 	<li><strong>Roasted Chickpeas</strong> — These are a great, satisfying snack packed with fiber and protein.</li>
 	<li><strong>Granola —</strong> Opt for either homemade or store-bought varieties high in protein and low in sugar and added oils.</li>
</ul>
If none of these healthy snacks appeals to you, there are endless alternatives for healthy snacks that can be stored at your desk or in the office pantry or fridge. The key is to choose whole foods high in fiber and protein instead of processed foods containing added sugars and industrialized oils. Read <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/nutritionfactslabel/\">nutrition labels</a>, and be sure to limit products with hydrogenated oil, refined flours, and trans fats. Healthy snacks can be satisfying and delicious. You don't need to undermine your efforts to eat well when mid-day hunger strikes.

4567,8,"2017-12-29 09:00:07","2017-12-29 09:00:07","Matcha tea benefits your health in a variety of ways. Since you consume the green tea leaf whole when using matcha, all of the tea's antioxidant levels are multiplied. Antioxidants help fight inflammation, protect against <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sun-damaged-skin/\">ultraviolet (UV) exposure</a> and heal existing damage, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/anti-aging-foods/\">slows premature aging</a>, and boost energy. According to oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), matcha ranks highest in the number of antioxidants, boasting five times the level of other plant-based foods. Matcha is also a great substitute for coffee, since the antioxidant levels help slow the absorption of caffeine into our system. Many people notice steady energy and intense focus when they drink matcha, as opposed to the high and subsequent crash they may experience with other caffeine sources.

Our matcha latte recipe harnesses these great matcha tea benefits. We’ve included collagen powder to add even more healing powers to the matcha base. Collagen powder helps heal our intestinal lining, has been shown to decrease wrinkles and cellulite, and improves joint pain. About  70 percent of our skin is collagen, which is what <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/best-foods-for-skin/\">gives our skin</a> its natural elasticity. Since our collagen production naturally decreases as we age, increasing our consumption of vitamin C (which helps manufacture collagen) and supplements can help keep our skin smooth and glowing. Matcha tea benefits are <a href=\"http://www.health.com/nutrition/what-is-matcha\">plentiful</a>, and this latte is a delicious delivery system!

4569,1,"2017-09-25 12:49:54","2017-09-25 12:49:54","Homemade granola bars can be a great healthy addition to packed lunches and after school snacks now that fall is in full swing. While pre-packaged foods are certainly convenient, we can't always guarantee they contain the most <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/healthyeating/\">wholesome ingredients</a> for our families. We've created these no-bake chocolate-cherry homemade granola bars filled will fiber, healthy fats, and flavors that kids and adults alike will love.

<strong>Oatmeal for Heart Health</strong>

The <a href=\"http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/bonnie-taub-dix-nutrition-intuition/reasons-why-you-should-eat-oatmeal-every-day/\">soluble fiber found in oatmeal</a> has been linked to lowering bad cholesterol (LDL), which decreases the risk for heart disease. It also helps keep you satiated longer, improves digestion, and assists in the maintenance of lower body weight. Meanwhile, the antioxidant content in oats fights inflammation throughout the body, which is great for heart function and warding off diseases like cancer.

<strong>Cherries for Restful Sleep</strong>

We love the tart flavor of cherries to balance the sweet cacao in this recipe. Plus, they pack an even bigger antioxidant punch than oatmeal. The type of antioxidants found in cherries blocks inflammatory enzymes, promoting health and decreasing muscular and joint pain. Cherries are rich in many micronutrients, but specifically in melatonin and tryptophan, a calming combination that facilitates restful sleep. In one study, participants were given unsweetened cherry juice for two weeks, and on average slept soundly for 90 minutes longer than the control group. For these homemade granola bars, choose an unsweetened variety, as <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/naturally_occurring_sugars_versus_added_sugars/\">processed sugar</a> is linked to breakouts, inflammation, and obesity.

<strong>Cacao for Staying Calm</strong>

Our homemade granola bars recipe uses cacao, which has more nutrients than processed cocoa powder, but the same great chocolate flavor. Cacao has a higher calcium content than cow's milk and is among the most reliable plant sources of iron. It's also known for magnesium, a mineral that is crucial for combating stress and staying calm. Magnesium has been shown to improve ADHD symptoms in children and reduce insomnia. If you choose chocolate chips over cacao, be sure to pick a darker variety with less added sugar.

<strong>Almond Butter for Blood Sugar Regulation</strong>

We've chosen wholesome carbohydrate sources for our homemade granola bars, but it's still important to pair them with healthy fats and protein to ensure sugars enter the bloodstream more slowly (the fiber content also helps with this). It's crucial to get a steady flow of energy from our snacks and meals, rather than a sharp increase that leads to a post-spike crash. Blood sugar stabilization helps with mood, appetite control, and sound sleep. Choosing raw nut butter keeps the micronutrient content higher. Almond butter provides a solid dose of monounsaturated fats (which are anti-inflammatory) and Vitamin E, which helps lower bad cholesterol levels.

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

2-3 cups rolled oats

1 cup cacao nibs, dark chocolate chips, or carob chips

1 cup almond butter

3/4 cup dried cherries

2/3 cup maple syrup or honey

1/4 cacao powder

1 tablespoon coconut oil

2 teaspoons vanilla

1/2 teaspoon salt

<strong>Step 1: </strong>Add almond butter, maple syrup, coconut oil, and salt to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 15-second increments until warm enough to mix thoroughly.

<strong>Step 2: </strong>Add cacao and vanilla to almond butter and mix thoroughly. Next add oats, chocolate chips, and cherries and fold in (optionally save some chocolate chips for the top of granola bars). Add the first two cups of oats first, then slowly add the third (if you prefer a dryer bar, add more oats).

<strong>Step 3: </strong>Line an 8x8 pan with parchment paper and coat thoroughly with non-stick cooking spray. Spread granola mixture, and press with hands or spatula until it's flat and even. Spread the remaining chocolate chips over mixture and press lightly so they stick.

<strong>Step 4: </strong>Freeze for one hour, then immediately remove from freezer. Cut into 12 bars and store in an airtight container for up to two weeks. Alternatively, you can keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours before cutting. Enjoy!

This happens when there's a disruption in the tissue's ordinary life cycle — new cells grow when the body doesn’t need them; old, damaged cells do not die off as they should; and the resulting buildup becomes a tumor. These malignant cells can spread by breaking off from the original growth and entering other body systems through lymph and blood vessels. Metastasis occurs when cancer cells travel, damaging other organs and body tissues.

<strong>Breast Cancer Awareness: Know the Facts</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women.</li>
 	<li>Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death among women.</li>
 	<li>Most breast cancers are found in women who are age 50 or older, but it can also affect younger women. Approximately 10 percent of breast cancer cases occur in women under the age of 45.</li>
 	<li>One in eight women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime.</li>
 	<li>Men can also get breast cancer, but it is far more rare. Less than one percent of breast cancer cases occur in men.</li>
 	<li>More than 200,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States each year, and more than 40,000 die of the disease.</li>
 	<li>There are more than 2.8 million breast cancer survivors in the United States.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Lowering Your Breast Cancer Risk</strong>

Beyond gender, the main factors that influence your risk of breast cancer are age and having a predisposition via mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. But many women who are diagnosed have no family history of the disease, and it's important to know other potential <a href=\"http://www.breastcancer.org/risk\">risk factors</a>. Here are ways you can reduce your personal risk:
<ul>
 	<li>Maintain a healthy weight.</li>
 	<li>Commit to regular exercise — at least four hours per week.</li>
 	<li>Avoid drinking alcohol, or limit intake to no more than one drink per day.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://www.helpguide.org/articles/diets/cancer-prevention-diet.htm\">Eat a whole foods, fresh, plant-centered diet</a>.</li>
 	<li>Avoid processed junk foods, and limit your sugar and refined carbohydrate intake.</li>
 	<li>Limit exposure to radiation from medical imaging tests, such as X-rays and CT scans.</li>
 	<li>Avoid and limit exposure to known <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/general-info/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens.html\">carcinogens</a> (chemicals which cause cancer).</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://community.breastcancer.org/livegreen/bpa-and-related-chemicals-linked-to-fat-gain-breast-cancer-risk/\">Avoid BPA in plastics.</a></li>
 	<li>Discuss the risks of hormone replacement therapy, oral contraception (birth control pills), and hormonal birth control methods with your doctor.</li>
 	<li>Take steps to improve your sleep if needed, and get 8 hours of sleep each night.</li>
 	<li>Do not smoke.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://eheintl.com/symptoms-of-stress/\">Reduce and manage stress</a>.</li>
</ul>
Be vigilant about breast cancer detection, and perform a <a href=\"http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/self_exam/bse_steps\">breast self-exam</a> each month. If you notice any changes in your breasts, such as lumps or skin changes, consult your physician right away. Also discuss the benefits and risks of mammograms and other screening procedures. Breast cancer prevention starts with healthy habits and taking action.

4655,1,"2017-10-20 09:30:38","2017-10-20 09:30:38","What is the link between estrogen and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/breast-cancer/\">breast cancer</a>?

The hormone, of course, is vital to sexual development and many important bodily functions. Before menopause, estrogen is produced mainly in the ovaries. After menopause, it is produced mostly in fat tissue. Throughout both her reproductive and post-menopausal years, a woman is exposed to different levels of estrogen from various sources.

Estrogen and breast cancer have at least some correlation. High levels of estrogen over long periods of time are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. A meta analysis of data from several different studies shows that <a href=\"https://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/HighLevelsofEstrogenintheBlood.html\">higher blood estrogen levels in premenopausal women increases breast cancer risk</a>. Women who have an earlier first menstrual period or a later menopause are more likely to develop breast cancer.

<strong>Estrogen and Breast Cancer: Effect of Hormone Replacement Therapy</strong>

Estrogen is sometimes prescribed to treat the symptoms of menopause, such as night sweats, sleeplessness, and hot flashes. Estrogen also provides the benefit of lowering the risk of bone thinning, or osteoporosis. That said, a large-scale clinical trial has was shown that the risks of hormone replacement therapy (estrogen plus progesterone) can be significant. Combined hormone therapy with estrogen and progesterone increases the incidence of blood clots, heart disease, and stroke. Moreover, prolonged exposure to high levels of estrogen increases the risk of uterine and breast cancers.

Estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy has also been shown to elevate breast cancer risk, but combined hormone replacement therapy increases that risk more substantially. High estrogen levels encourage cell division in the uterine and breast tissues, and cells that are actively dividing are thought to have a greater chance of DNA damage. The more cells with DNA damage, the higher the chance of developing cancer.

<strong>Factors that Impact Estrogen Levels</strong>

Blood estrogen levels are affected by a number of variables. Some of these are under your control. You can regulate your blood estrogen levels by:
<ul>
 	<li>Keeping your weight in check. Fatty tissue impacts estrogen production, and by maintaining a healthy weight, you decrease your breast cancer risk, particularly after menopause.</li>
 	<li>Getting and staying physically active. Exercise at least four hours per week.</li>
 	<li>Limiting your alcohol intake. Avoiding alcohol consumption entirely is best.</li>
 	<li>Avoiding menopausal hormone replacement therapy.</li>
</ul>
These action steps can help keep your estrogen levels in check, and help lower your risk of breast cancer and other chronic diseases.

<strong>Additional Considerations</strong>

There are additional measures you can take to combat overall cancer risks. These include:
<ul>
 	<li>Adopting a fresh, whole foods, plant-centered diet. Limit or avoid refined sugars, carbohydrates, and processed meats. Opt for whole grains, clean proteins, moderate amounts of healthy fats, and an abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables.</li>
 	<li>Commit to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-physical-examination/\">routine preventive medical screenings</a>.</li>
 	<li>Do a <a href=\"http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/self_exam/bse_steps\">breast-self exam</a> each month, and watch for any changes in skin and breast tissue.</li>
 	<li>Manage and reduce stress as much as possible.</li>
 	<li>Get eight hours of quality sleep each night.</li>
 	<li>Do not smoke or use tobacco.</li>
 	<li>Avoid and limit exposure to carcinogens.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140306163359.htm\">Avoid BPA in plastics</a>.</li>
 	<li>Limit exposure to radiation.</li>
</ul>
Estrogen and breast cancer may be linked, but the keys to lowering your risk are education and engagement. Healthy lifestyle choices and preventive screenings are critical. Not every illness can be anticipated or prevented, but by focusing on wellness, you can embrace habits that will boost and optimize your ability to stave off disease.

Relaxation therapy uses a <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/relaxation-technique/art-20045368\">combination of techniques</a> including breathing, muscle relaxation, and guided imagery to help regulate the body’s stress response. The approach is applicable in a variety of situations. Whether we are coping with ongoing chronic stress or a specific stressful event, these tactics can empower us, helping to moderate physical and emotional tension. <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/manage_your_stress_with_these_techniques/\">Many related practices</a> can be learned without professional assistance. But it is useful to seek guidance from a trained practitioner to understand how to mitigate the body’s stress responses with relaxation therapy.

Stress affects the body. After a triggering incident, our autonomic nervous system activates the “fight or flight” response. Breathing and heartbeat quicken, and blood vessels throughout the body dilate in order to prepare either to fight a potential adversary or flee the situation. By utilizing relaxation therapy, we help the body to reverse the effects of the stress response on the nervous system, restoring physical and emotional equilibrium. The cornerstone of good relaxation therapy is learning how to regulate breathing. We first recognize the status of our breathing in the midst of the stress response, and then we consciously and gradually slow the rate down to a more relaxed pace. As breathing normalizes, so does the heartbeat. This helps the body shift out of \"fight or flight.\"

<strong>Relaxation Therapy in the Workplace</strong>

It is known that stressed workers are sicker, more frequently absent, and less productive. They also have higher rates of addiction, depression, chronic illnesses, and cardiovascular disease. <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">When employees utilize stress reduction and relaxation therapy, it creates a healthier, more productive workplace. While relaxation therapy sessions with a trained professional may be required in some instances, there are plenty of low- to no-cost ways to cope with stress on the job:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Meditate</strong>: Apps like <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/\">Calm</a>, <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a>, <a href=\"http://themindfulnessapp.com/\">The Mindfulness App</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.aurahealth.io/\">Aura</a> are easy to plug into for meditations that last anywhere from 3 to 30 minutes. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3485650/\">Studies</a> show that mindfulness meditation helps regulate the stress response, thereby calming us.</li>
 	<li><strong>Squeeze Stress Balls</strong>: These malleable, soft balls can be squeezed for tactile stress reduction and muscle tension relief.</li>
 	<li><strong>Drink </strong><strong>Herbal Teas</strong>: Green tea, linden tea, and chamomile tea, among others, have properties which may help relieve stress.</li>
 	<li><strong>Use Sound Machines</strong>: These devices create white noise (like the sound of a moving fan), or pleasant, relaxing sounds such as waves crashing. They also help mask irritating ambient noise. Using them can help ease the body’s stress response and lead to deeper, more restful sleep at night.</li>
 	<li><strong>Listen to Music</strong>: Music is excellent for relaxation and improving mood, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21767754\">studies show</a> that listening can trigger measurable, biochemical stress-relieving effects.</li>
 	<li><strong>Practice Deep Breathing</strong>: Controlled, <a href=\"https://www.stress.org/take-a-deep-breath/\">deep breathing</a> helps lower the heart rate and blood pressure, and promotes feelings of relaxation and calm.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Other Techniques and Practices for Stress Relief:</strong>

4670,1,"2017-10-05 09:26:40","2017-10-05 09:26:40","Depression is not simply feeling sad, despite how it's frequently characterized in our culture. There are many types of depression, and it can be a very <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/what_causes_depression/\">complex disease</a>. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-symptoms-and-types\">symptoms</a> differ in severity and duration from person to person. That said, depression is often distinguished by prolonged periods of hopelessness, feelings of being overwhelmed, disrupted sleep, irritability, and a number of other mood disturbances. It is important to understand depression's warning signs so that it can be treated effectively.

<strong>Warning Signs for Depression</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>A sad, anxious, or desolate mood that persists</li>
 	<li>Sleep disturbances such as insomnia or hypersomnia (oversleeping)</li>
 	<li>Cognitive problems such as difficulty concentrating or remembering things</li>
 	<li>Feeling hopeless</li>
 	<li>Irritability, chronic frustration, or pessimism</li>
 	<li>Disruptions in appetite; overeating or undereating</li>
 	<li>Restlessness</li>
 	<li>Thoughts of suicide and / or suicide attempts</li>
 	<li>Chronic physical symptoms that do not correspond to an underlying medical condition, such as digestive problems, persistent headaches, or body aches</li>
 	<li>Fatigue</li>
 	<li>Feelings of worthlessness or persistent guilt</li>
 	<li>Loss of interest in activities one usually enjoys</li>
</ul>
Depression is diagnosed when a person has experienced some or all of these symptoms for two weeks or longer. It is important to seek help from a licensed mental health professional as early as possible. Depression can be difficult to treat, particularly when it has persisted for a while. Also, different types of depression may need specialized support.

<strong>Types of Depression</strong><strong> </strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Major Clinical Depression: </strong>The most commonly diagnosed form of depression, characterized by hopelessness and a profoundly depressed mood that persists for more than two weeks.</li>
 	<li><strong>Dysthymia: </strong>Similar to major depression, but symptoms are complex and chronic while lasting for two years or longer.</li>
 	<li><strong>Seasonal Affective Disorder: </strong>Sufferers experience the symptoms depression, but tied to seasonal change, usually taking place in fall or winter, when sunlight decreases and the days become shorter.</li>
 	<li><strong>Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood:</strong> Characterized by the typical symptoms of major depression, but the disordered mood is in response to a life event or change resulting in a significant stress increase.</li>
 	<li><strong>Postpartum Depression:</strong> The hormones estrogen and progesterone increase dramatically in a woman’s body during pregnancy, but rapidly drop to normal levels soon after delivery (<a href=\"http://www.postpartumprogress.com/womens-mental-health-treatment-programs-specialists-us-canada-australia\">postpartum</a>). In some women, this hormonal drop can trigger the symptoms of major depression, and is more likely to recur with subsequent pregnancies. Early intervention is key.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Treatment for Types of Depression</strong>

There is no shame in seeking treatment for depression — or any other mental health condition. Mental health awareness is increasing, and old stigmas rooted in outdated misinformation should never interfere with someone getting the assistance he or she needs. It takes strength and courage to ask for help. <a href=\"https://www.helpguide.org/articles/depression/depression-treatment.htm\">Treatment for depression</a> is often a combination of interventions, tailored to the individual's unique set of biological, psychological, and social factors. Types of depression also require different types of treatment. What's effective in one context may not affect change in another. Treatment takes time and patience, and may include medication, psychotherapy, self-help methods, support groups, and nutritional and lifestyle modifications. There is also evidence that mindfulness <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-meditation/\">meditation techniques</a> are helpful in treating some forms of depression. Help is available, and despite how difficult depression can be, with the appropriate <a href=\"https://psychcentral.com/lib/social-support-is-critical-for-depression-recovery/\">social support</a> and treatment plan, improvement and recovery are possible.

4681,1,"2017-10-10 09:00:27","2017-10-10 09:00:27","Good brain food is critical to wellness. It's important for mental and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/how_do_i_prevent_cognitive_impairment_and_dementia/\">cognitive health</a> to nourish our brains with the proper balance of nutrients. Including quality brain food in your diet will help keep your mind sharp and clear for as long as possible. The brain responds powerfully to the right fuel, such as high quality carbohydrates, fats, and antioxidants from fresh fruits and vegetables. The following foods help prevent inflammation and degenerative diseases, and protect your memory, attention span, and overall cognitive function.

<strong>Fish </strong>- Essential fatty acids (EFAs) cannot be manufactured by the body, so we need to get them from our diets. Oily fish like wild salmon, mackerel, sardines, and tuna are great sources of omega-3 fatty acids in the form of <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/what-to-know-about-omega-3s-and-fish#1\">EPA and DHA</a>. (Excellent plant-based sources of brain-boosting fats are walnuts, flax seeds, chia, and pumpkin seeds.) These EFAs help preserve brain function while also promoting good cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health. Not only do EPA and DHA decrease the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, they also help promote the production of the feel-good brain chemical, serotonin, which helps us manage stress and regulate mood.

<em>Diet tip</em>: Choose only wild fish. When eating salmon, wild Alaskan is best. Also, limit tuna to no more than six ounces per week to <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/oceans/mercury-alert-canned-tuna-safe-eat\">minimize mercury exposure</a>.

<strong>Berries </strong>- Fresh berries, particularly blueberries, are loaded with antioxidants, which help promote brain health and function. Blueberries are especially excellent for overall health: they're low glycemic, high in fiber, and have been positively linked to lowered Alzheimer’s risk. Evidence also suggests that blueberries help improve memory and protect against general cognitive decline.

<em>Diet tip</em>: Eat a serving of blueberries every day. Whenever possible, buy organic berries. When out of season, organic frozen berries are a good option (great for smoothies). Other fantastic brain-boosting varieties include cranberries, blackberries, and cherries.

<strong>Tomatoes</strong> - High in the powerhouse antioxidant, <a href=\"https://www.drweil.com/vitamins-supplements-herbs/supplements-remedies/lycopene/\">lycopene</a>, tomatoes help protect against free radical damage in cells, helping to stave off dementia and other degenerative diseases.

<em>Diet tip</em>: Lycopene increases when tomatoes are cooked. Opt for organic, low sugar tomato sauces, or try gently roasting your tomatoes with a drizzle of olive oil.

<strong>Avocados</strong> - Avocados are the highest in protein and lowest in sugar of any fruit, making them among the healthiest foods you can eat. Packed with vitamins C and B, and rich in folate and vitamin K, avocados are protective against strokes and blood clots in the brain. They also help improve memory and overall cognitive function. Their high vitamin E content fights the onset of Alzheimer’s and dementia.

<em>Diet tip</em>: Add about a quarter to half of an avocado to your smoothies. Avocados also make a great fat replacement for your favorite baked goods.

<strong>Broccoli </strong>- High levels of choline and vitamin K help keep your memory healthy and sharp, making broccoli a terrific brain food. Just one cup of broccoli provides about 150 percent of the daily recommended intake of vitamin C.

<em>Diet tip</em>: Lightly steam your broccoli until bright green but still firm (about four minutes), and add to eggs, whole grain pasta, or as a side dish to your meal. You can also add raw florets to your salads, or serve with a veggie tray and a healthy dip.

<strong>Dark Chocolate (Cacao)</strong> - Cacao is a great brain food loaded with flavanols, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, promoting robust circulation and blood flow to the brain.

<em>Diet tip</em>: Opt for organic dark chocolate bars of 70 percent or higher to keep exposure to refined and added sugars to a minimum. Your best bet is 100 percent raw, organic cacao with no added sugar — this is a wonderful addition to smoothies, and great for healthier baking at home.

Remember that eating for overall systemic health goes hand in hand with eating good brain food. While certain foods offer particular support for the brain (the above list is by no means exhaustive), a diet of whole foods, primarily centered on plants and fresh produce, will support your body and brain health in profound ways. What we eat is vital to sustaining memory, mental clarity, and cognitive function across our life spans.

4683,1,"2017-10-06 09:00:36","2017-10-06 09:00:36","Stress is not always a negative thing. In moderate amounts, it can motivate us and increase our concentration and clarity. But when life or <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/preventing-workplace-stress/\">workplace stress</a> becomes chronic, the symptoms can be incredibly detrimental to our wellbeing. Stress management <a href=\"https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/stress-management.htm\">becomes essential</a>. Here are ten techniques that will help your stress management, keeping you mentally and physically healthy even when pressure hits.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Exercise at least three times per week</strong>. <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/health-benefits-of-exercise-is-a-fountain-of-youth/\">Exercise</a> releases endorphins, which help you relax and feel better. Many fitness activities, including yoga, also stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system (the part of your nervous system which resets and calms your stress response). And if that wasn't enough, regular exercise also improves sleep.</li>
 	<li><strong>Practicing <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/about-meditation/\">meditation</a></strong> has been shown to decrease symptoms of stress and anxiety while facilitating calmness and overall mental wellbeing. Meditation is also good cognitive training — it retrains us to observe and release negative thought patterns. And the benefits of meditation accumulate over time. So find a <a href=\"http://liveanddare.com/types-of-meditation/\">method</a> you enjoy, and add it to your stress management regimen.</li>
 	<li><strong>Try progressive muscle relaxation</strong> (deep muscle relaxation). Progressively tense each muscle group, breathe deeply, and then release. It's particularly helpful to do this before going to sleep.</li>
 	<li><strong>Make a list of important work and personal tasks you need to accomplish each day</strong>. Working through your daily list will help you feel organized and on top of things, giving you a sense of mastery over your schedule and workload.</li>
 	<li><strong>Make time to sit, rest, and eat your meals mindfully</strong>. Try to avoid letting your mealtime be disturbed. Avoid stressful or upsetting conversation while eating. Allow yourself both nourishment and some separation from the daily grind.</li>
 	<li><strong>Practice good <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/how_to_keep_good_sleep_hygiene/\">sleep hygiene</a></strong>. Structure your sleep schedule so that you are going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. Lower the lights and turn off your phone and devices at least one hour before bedtime, and sleep in a well-darkened room.</li>
 	<li><strong>Try diaphragmatic breathing</strong>. When under stress, our breathing tends to be shallow and centered in the chest. Diaphragmatic breathing (<a href=\"https://psychcentral.com/lib/learning-deep-breathing/\">deep breathing</a>) helps to regulate the body’s stress response and increases feelings of calm.</li>
 	<li><strong>Seek support</strong>. Find at least one person you can confide in and share your concerns tied to the matters causing you stress. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921311/\">The more social support you have, the more stress resilience</a> you will develop. If you feel isolated, you may need to create more community in your life. Seek out new activities, join an <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/join-adult-recreational-sports-team/\">adult recreational sports team</a> for connection and exercise, or take a new class to connect with others who have similar interests.</li>
 	<li><strong>Laugh more</strong>. Make a point of watching funny movies or stand-up comedy. Regular laughter is one of the easiest and most effective stress management devices. It lowers stress hormones in the body, relaxes your muscles to release tension, and helps put things in perspective.</li>
 	<li><strong>Learn to say no</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/setting-boundaries-for-stress-management-3144985\">Set boundaries</a> around your life demands as much as possible to avoid becoming overloaded. Delegate responsibilities when you can, and give yourself permission to implement limits on how much you can take on at a given time. You might encounter some friction in your relationships as others adjust to these new boundaries, but you are ensuring better mental and physical health (and relationships) in the long run by learning to say no.</li>
</ol>
Cultivating stress management is a key component good mental health hygiene. Unchecked stress is a major contributing factor to illness. Making time for self-care is crucial to staying well in the long term. While it takes vigilance and effort to ensure you are properly moderating stress, it's well worth the investment.

4706,1,"2017-10-23 12:00:31","2017-10-23 12:00:31","October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, an opportunity to address a destructive and widespread health crisis. While it takes many forms, domestic violence is characterized by an intimate partner's pattern of abusive behavior. This abuse can include psychological, sexual, and physical elements. It can start when the relationship does, or it can emerge after time. It can be conspicuous to others or hidden behind closed doors. It can occur in an established marriage or in a brand new romance. It affects victims across socioeconomic and educational levels, sexual orientations, and ethnic backgrounds. While the majority of cases involve a male perpetrator and a female victim, domestic violence can also victimize men or people of either gender in a same-sex relationship.

<strong>Statistics About Domestic Violence and Abuse</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>More than one in three women (35.6%) in the United States has experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner</li>
 	<li>One in four women (24.3%) and one in seven men (13.8%) in the United States have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner</li>
 	<li>Almost half of all women (48.4%) have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner</li>
 	<li>Women between 18 and 34 years old generally experience the highest rates of domestic violence</li>
 	<li>Roughly 15% of all violent crime in the United States is intimate partner violence</li>
</ul>
At its core, domestic violence is about power. One partner uses abusive tactics to control the other. The abuse can be physically damaging, emotionally manipulative, and/or psychologically isolating. Many people assume domestic violence (also labeled intimate partner violence) refers only to dramatic instances of physical assault. But the abuse can be more subtle and insidious while still causing deep, lasting damage. It's important to recognize the signs of potential abuse to ensure that your relationship — or those involving your family and friends — is healthy and safe.

<strong>Warnings Signs of Domestic Violence and Abuse</strong>

Abuse consolidates control with one partner through a combination of tactics including (but not limited to): physical threats and attacks, stalking, sexual coercion and violence, social isolation, emotional degradation and manipulation, repeated threats, and management of all aspects of the other's life. Over time, the pattern of behavior erode's the victim's independence, self-esteem, and wherewithal to escape. An abusive partner may:
<ul>
 	<li>Isolate partner from friends and family</li>
 	<li>Insult, ridicule, or demean partner</li>
 	<li>Coerce partner into sex</li>
 	<li>Control partner's actions and decisions</li>
 	<li>Undermine partner's studies or career</li>
 	<li>Threaten to harm partner's loved ones</li>
 	<li>Make partner feel guilty</li>
 	<li>Be violent toward pets</li>
 	<li>Exploit partner's finances or control his or her money</li>
 	<li>Express intense jealousy or possessiveness</li>
 	<li>Gaslight partner (intentionally cause partner to doubt his or her own sanity)</li>
 	<li>Blame partner for anything that goes wrong</li>
 	<li>Take advantage of partner's insecurities</li>
 	<li>Have an unpredictable or easily triggered temper</li>
 	<li>Refuse to give partner privacy in the home or online</li>
</ul>
Often, an abuser will successfully mask his or her temperament when interacting with people outside the relationship. Perpetrators often come across as \"charming,\" which can be how they attract partners in the first place. Moreover, an abusive partner typically either minimizes the severity of the physical or psychological abuse or deflects the blame, pinning it on external circumstances like stress or even the victim. Such tactics are consistent with the nature of the abuse itself. Perpetrators seek control, and they'll typically manipulate the image of the relationship in order to preserve their domination.

<strong>Domestic Violence or Abuse Effects on the Abused</strong>

It can be difficult to see an intimate partner's abuse for what it is, or to escape a relationship that's become dangerous. Many times, the victim will find it easier to placate an abuser than to risk more violence or abuse by standing up to it. But even in situations where a victim believes he or she can \"manage\" or \"survive\" the level of abuse, there are devastating effects that accumulate over time. Victims of domestic violence or abuse may experience:
<ul>
 	<li>Feelings of isolation and helplessness</li>
 	<li>Intense depression and suicidal ideation</li>
 	<li>Separation from friends and family</li>
 	<li>Anger or guilt toward themselves for the situation</li>
 	<li>Emotional withdrawal</li>
 	<li>Diminished performance at work or school</li>
 	<li>Alcohol or drug abuse</li>
 	<li>Fear for the wellbeing of their children and other loved ones</li>
 	<li>Anxiety over how to survive without partner</li>
 	<li>Shame over allowing abuse to persist and worsen</li>
</ul>
These effects explain part of the reason why it can be so difficult for abuse victims to leave a relationship in which they are being badly harmed. There are also social obstacles — lacking familiarity with healthy relationships means people often wrongly believe abuse is normal; religious traditions may make an imbalance of power seem appropriate; often, victims fear backlash from friends and family who will \"judge\" them harshly. Additionally, many victims still feel love or affection for their abusers and are reluctant to sever ties.

<strong>How to Get Help for Domestic Violence or Abuse</strong>

But domestic violence and abuse should never be tolerated. It is destructive and must be escaped. The dangers are real, varied, and impact the victim in ways he or she may not realize. It's important to realize that help exists, and to reach out as soon as possible. Here are some resources:

4722,1,"2017-10-16 21:26:33","2017-10-16 21:26:33","One of the <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-exercise/\">best forms of exercise</a> is simple, free, and overlooked. Going for <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Walking-Your-steps-to-health\">regular walks</a> is <em>great</em> for your health. It can help you reduce stress, lose weight, lower blood pressure, and keep chronic illnesses at bay — and all you need is a pair of comfortable shoes. Here are some of the benefits of walking just 30 minutes a day.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Elevate and improve your mood </strong>- Walking can help alleviate symptoms of depression and lift your mood. Studies have shown that walking for 30 minutes a day can be as effective as antidepressant medications for some people.</li>
 	<li><strong>Slim down</strong> - Regular walking is one of the best low-impact ways to lose weight and trim your waistline. Daily walking increases metabolism, burns calories, and protects against muscle loss. It also improves the body’s insulin response, which helps reduce belly fat.</li>
 	<li><strong>Improve circulation</strong> - Walking helps ward off varicose veins, prevents heart disease, strengthens the heart, and lowers blood pressure. Studies have found that post-menopausal women who walked one to two miles per day lowered their blood pressure by 11 points in just 24 weeks. Women who walked 30 minutes per day also slashed their risk of stroke by 20 percent.</li>
 	<li><strong>Boost your creativity</strong> - The benefits of walking are often unexpected. A recent study shows that regular <a href=\"http://everybodywalk.org/lacking-inspiration-exercise-found-to-boost-creativity/\">walking heightens creativity</a> and improves divergent and convergent thinking, both of which are associated with high levels of creative thinking and problem solving.</li>
 	<li><strong>Deepen and improve your sleep</strong> - Walking can help you fall asleep faster, sleep more soundly, and prevents and improves insomnia. A walk in the early morning hours can be especially helpful keeping you in sync with your circadian rhythms and sleep cycle.</li>
 	<li><strong>Heighten immunity </strong>- Regular walking and exercise helps boost your immune system. Because it's also helpful for reducing excess weight and belly fat, it reduces your risk of developing chronic illnesses like cancers and Type 2 diabetes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reduce pain </strong>- Walking may help lessen symptoms and reduce discomfort for those suffering with chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia and arthritis. The gentle, low-impact nature of walking can help improve functioning while reducing pain.</li>
 	<li><strong>Improve and maintain memory</strong> - Walking boosts function in the hippocampus — the part of the brain involved in learning and memory. Research has shown that age-related memory impairment is lessened in those who regularly walk.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bolster bone strength </strong>- The physical benefits of walking can be long-term. For instance, it can help strengthen your bones and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. One study shows that women who walk for at least 4 hours per week have a 40 percent reduced risk of hip fractures. While many other forms of exercise (such as weightlifting and running) also offer bone strengthening benefits, walking is an excellent low-impact option.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keep your brain sharp</strong> <strong>and slow the aging process</strong> - <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/news/20101128/walking-may-cut-alzheimers-risk#1\">Regular walking is shown to maintain cognitive function</a>, and lower the risk of age-related dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and other brain disorders. Researchers have also found that those who walk for exercise have preserved and lengthened telomeres, the parts of our DNA that shorten as we age. Regular walkers tend to look younger than their years — and may be younger on a cellular level, too.</li>
</ol>
For stress relief, preventing illness, boosting mood, and improving your overall quality of life, exercise is tough to beat. Walking is an easy way to reap the benefits of exercise with a no-cost, low-impact workout that gets you outside in the fresh air. Just 30 minutes a day, several days a week, is all it takes to see improvement thanks to the benefits of walking.

4730,1,"2017-10-18 18:28:27","2017-10-18 18:28:27","Few foods represent autumn better than butternut squash. Roasted, this vegetable caramelizes into a buttery, decadent treat. We've taken the roasting process one step further to create this simple yet incredibly flavorful butternut squash soup that will wow anyone.

Fall is peak season for butternut squash, so the flavor will be at its best. In addition to serving as an ideal base for a blended soup, butternut squash has a number of health benefits. It's full of dietary fiber, which improves digestion and lowers the risk for heart disease. It's also rich in B6, which helps elevate your moods, improves brain function, and facilitates healthy blood pressure levels.

The rich, orange hue of butternut squash can be credited to nutrients known as carotenoids. Carotenoids are a type of antioxidant commonly found in yellow, orange, and red produce. They protect eye health, prevent cardiovascular disease, help skin health, and even improve male fertility. Eating carotenoid-rich foods with fat helps improve its bioavailability to the body, so drizzling a little olive oil on top of the squash is a great idea for both flavor and health.

Beyond adding even more taste to the butternut squash soup, sage has long been used for its medicinal purposes. The oils found in sage are both antiseptic and antibacterial, making it the perfect herb to choose as cold and flu season kicks into high gear. Sage is also rich in vitamin K, which helps activate proteins produced by the liver, ensuring proper blood clotting. Bone metabolism (which allows us to replace old bone cells with healthy ones) and the regulation of calcium in the blood are two other important tasks in which vitamin K plays a role.

Choosing high quality, organic vegetable broth makes this butternut squash soup vegan and yields even more health benefits. The broth helps hydrate the body, which improves digestion, regulates body temperature, increases circulation and energy, and prevents muscle cramps. Additionally, the broth retains many of the antioxidants and minerals found in the vegetables and herbs used to make it. Saving produce scraps you'd otherwise toss and storing them in the freezer is a great way to utilize food waste <em>and </em>produce a homemade vegetable broth.

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>1 large butternut squash</li>
 	<li>1/2 small onion</span></li>
 	<li>1 small shallot</span></li>
 	<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</span></li>
 	<li>3-4 cloves garlic</span></li>
 	<li>1 small sweet potato</span></li>
 	<li>4 cups vegetable or chicken broth</span></li>
 	<li>3-4 thyme sprigs</span></li>
 	<li>1-2 sage bunches</span></li>
 	<li>salt</span></li>
 	<li>pepper</span></li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 1: Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Cut butternut squash in half, scoop out seeds, and place on a baking sheet flesh side up. Coat in olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 45-60 minutes, until flesh is golden brown and easily pierced with a fork.</strong>

<strong>Step 2: While squash roasts, prepare vegetables. Peel and chop onion, shallot, and garlic. Pick off 5-6 sage leaves, and leave 1-2 sage sprigs whole (leaves attached to stem). Peel sweet potato.</strong>

<strong>Step 3: Steam sweet potato until easily pierced with a fork. While sweet potato steams, add olive oil and onions to a saute pan over medium heat. Saute onions for 4-5 minutes, then add shallots and garlic, and saute for 2 additional minutes.</strong>

<strong>Step 4: Pour broth over onions. Add thyme and sage leaves (the ones attached to the stem), and set the individual sage leaves aside for use later. Simmer for 10 minutes, then remove from heat. Remove sage and thyme and discard.</strong>

4750,1,"2017-10-18 20:34:05","2017-10-18 20:34:05","Walking meditation can be a wonderful addition to your self-care regimen. It’s also a helpful introduction to sitting meditation, as it’s easier for some people to do first. The renowned Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh has said that the “practice of mindful walking is a profound and pleasurable way to deepen our connection with our body and the earth.\" While most of us walk only to get from one place to the next, walking meditation asks us to refocus attention on the act itself — to be mindful of how we walk and our level of presence. Evidence suggests that the <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-meditation/\">health benefits</a> of meditation increase the more we practice. To start, though, it's worth trying walking meditation for just 10 minutes a day for a week. Like they say: baby steps.

<strong>Why Walking Meditation?</strong>

Walking meditation is usually slower than a typical stroll, and it incorporates breathing coordination or other focusing techniques. Part of its beauty is its simplicity: walking meditation does not need to be a time-consuming or complicated activity, nor does it require a specific setting. It teaches us to bring <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/mindfulness-exercises-for-everyday-life-3145187\">mindfulness</a> into one of our primary actions. It also serves as an excellent starting point for beginning meditators, as it’s closer to our everyday experiences and routines than traditional sitting forms of meditation.

Walking meditation teaches us to pay attention to the movements of our body, legs, and feet, as we walk. Unlike seated meditation practices, walking meditation gives us a deeper interaction with the world around us; our eyes remain open as we walk, breathe, and attend to our mindfulness.

<strong>How to Practice Walking Meditation</strong>

Walking meditation is best done outdoors, and it is recommended that it not be combined with other activities (such as exercise or running errands). It’s best to let this walk be focused solely on meditation so you can immerse yourself in the experience with undivided attention.
<ul>
 	<li>Choose a time and place that will allow you to walk undisturbed, peacefully, and without traffic. Try to do your meditation at the same time each day. Begin by standing still, and take some deep, relaxed breaths. Place your attention on the breath to start, then allow your breathing to return to normal while you continue observing, but without forcing the breath. Now bring your awareness to all of your body. Notice any sensations as they arise, and fully absorb how your body feels as you stand and breathe.</li>
 	<li>Once you feel present and relaxed, begin walking. Walk at a somewhat slower pace than you normally might, and notice all the sensations in your body as you walk, from head to toe. You can allow your arms and hands to swing loosely at your sides, or you can gently grasp your hands at your navel. Let your leg muscles relax, and feel down into the soles of your feet. As you observe how your body feels while walking, continue gently bringing your attention back to your internal experience. The aim is to have your focus on the physical experience of walking; if you notice your mind becoming preoccupied with other thoughts, gently bring your attention back to your body's movement. Observe the sensations in as much detail as possible.</li>
 	<li>Continue scanning your body, going from the soles of your feet to the top of your head, as you notice the sensations of walking. When your mind begins to wander, bring your attention back to the sensations in your body.</li>
</ul>
There are some slight variations to approaching walking meditation, so <a href=\"http://liveanddare.com/walking-meditation/\">find the method</a> you like best. This is a profound yet simple practice which can help re-energize, center, and calm you. As with any meditation practice there is no set amount of time you must set aside; start with ten minutes per day if you can, but even five minutes is beneficial. Begin with what feels manageable to you, and build your practice from there.

Give yourself plenty of time to build endurance and plan for your event. If you’re already in great shape, you will need to maintain your fitness level. If you are working your way towards a new goal, consider the time it will take to increase your strength and stamina: the longer the event, the more time you will need. Once you know how much time you will need for preparation and training, set up your schedule, and create your weekly training plan. You can track your progress in an app like <a href=\"https://runkeeper.com/index\">Runkeeper</a>.

4790,1,"2017-10-25 08:17:58","2017-10-25 08:17:58","Mammograms do not prevent <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/breast-cancer-awareness/\">breast cancer</a>, but they are vital to the detection of the disease when it's still in its early stages and easier to treat. Diagnosing breast cancer early reduces the chance of dying from the illness by 30 percent or more. Additionally, prompt detection means local cancers (which have not metastasized) are treatable without mastectomy (breast removal).

<strong>Are Mammograms Risky?</strong>

A mammogram involves a low-dose X-ray that emits a minimal amount of radiation (less than a standard chest X-ray). The procedure is safe. Specialists examine the scan for any changes or abnormalities developing in the breast tissue. The primary risk mammograms carry is that false negatives and false positives are possible. Sometimes an abnormality that looks like cancer — such as a cyst or dense breast tissue — is reported but turns out to be benign. Normal breast tissue also sometimes conceals cancer that fails to show up on the scan.

Both false positives and false negatives can cause stress and upset, and the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/mammograms/limitations-of-mammograms.html\">limitations in mammography</a> mean additional screening methods may be necessary. Performing breast self-exams and getting regular clinical breast exams from your healthcare provider are also important. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scanning techniques are sometimes ordered to analyze the breast tissue. But mammography is still the most powerful method for detecting abnormalities.

<a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/healthy/find-cancer-early/cancer-screening-guidelines/american-cancer-society-guidelines-for-the-early-detection-of-cancer.html\">It is recommended</a> that women begin having yearly mammograms by age 40, or earlier if they are at high risk. By age 55, a mammogram every other year is recommended. Regardless of age, all women should report any changes in their breasts to their doctor.

<strong>What to Know Before Your Mammogram</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Where to go</strong> - Find a facility that is FDA-certified and specializes in mammograms. If possible, go to the same location annually so that your imaging can be easily monitored over time. If you are being seen at a new facility, provide the radiologist with your previous scans so they can be analyzed against your new ones.</li>
 	<li><strong>When to go</strong> - It is best to schedule your mammogram the week after your menstrual period. Your breasts are less likely to be swollen or tender at this time, so results are clearer, and the test will be more comfortable.</li>
 	<li><strong>An abnormal result does not mean you definitely have breast cancer</strong> - About 10 percent of women receive results that require further testing, and while 8 to 10 percent of these women require a biopsy, about 80 percent of these biopsies are benign.</li>
 	<li><strong>The procedure is fast </strong>- A mammogram only takes about 20 minutes, and discomfort is minimal for most women. To avoid the anxiety of waiting for results, choose a facility that will provide them before you leave.</li>
 	<li><strong>Don’t apply deodorant before your visit </strong>- Avoid deodorants, perfumes, powders, lotions, or creams under your arms or on your breasts. Particles in these substances can be seen on a mammogram and cause confusion. Remove any jewelry, and wear loose, comfortable clothing to your appointment.</li>
 	<li><strong>Consider over-the-counter pain medication </strong>-<strong> </strong>Aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen can offer relief if you experience discomfort during mammograms.</li>
</ul>
<strong>What to Expect at Your Mammogram</strong>

The procedure takes about 20 minutes. Breast tissue is compressed between two plates for a few seconds while an X-ray scan is taken. The breast will then be repositioned and compressed again to get an image from a different angle. The process is then repeated on the other breast. Your facility may provide same-day results, or it can take up to 30 days to receive them. If your doctor finds anything of concern, you will usually be contacted within a week to take new images or undergo further tests. You doctor may also order additional tests if this is your first mammogram, for comparison purposes.

<strong>Mammogram Cost</strong>

Medicare and nearly all private insurers cover annual mammograms with no co-pay or out-of-pocket costs. <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/find-free-or-low-cost-mammograms-429861\">Free and lost-cost options</a> are also available for uninsured or low-income women. Contact the American Cancer Society Helpline at 1-800-227-2345 for more information and to find a program near you.

4803,1,"2017-10-31 09:17:15","2017-10-31 09:17:15","Halloween is about costumes, carved pumpkins, scary stories, and... candy. Lots of candy. Treats are obviously a big part of Halloween, and, as with many holidays, less-than-healthy temptations are hard to resist. But as those big bags of candy come into your house, it's worth keeping in mind just how unhealthy sugar can be in large quantities.

It's not that you shouldn't be allowed to enjoy the (occasional) overindulgence on days like Halloween. But it's important to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/naturally_occurring_sugars_versus_added_sugars/\">know your sugars</a>, and to avoid sliding into any poor habits with sweets. It can be all too easy to snack mindlessly on mini candy bars and other treats as the holidays begin. But studies show <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23719144\">sugar has addictive properties</a>, and it wreaks havoc on our health in multiple ways.

<strong>Sugar and Weight Gain</strong>

The ingredients used to make candy are full of empty calories, highly processed sugars, fats, and food dyes. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/what-happens-to-your-body-an-hour-after-a-sugar-binge-a6701051.html\">Bingeing</a> on sugar will cause the pounds to add up, and many people struggle to keep sugar intake to a minimum. It’s far too easy to overdo our consumption of sugary treats.

<strong>Sugar and Tooth Decay</strong>

Eating too much candy leads to cavities and enamel damage. The bacteria that cause cavities feed on sugar, so the more you eat, the more these bacteria are able to multiply. These bacteria also damage gums, leading to corrosion and even tooth loss. Tacky candies like taffy, caramel, and fruit chews stick to teeth, leading to enamel damage and tooth decay.

<strong>Sugar and Increased Disease Risk</strong>

Diets high in refined sugars lower the strength and effectiveness of the immune system, compromising your body's resistance to viruses and disease. Consumption of industrialized fats and sugar leads to <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/eating-too-much-added-sugar-increases-the-risk-of-dying-with-heart-disease-201402067021\">obesity and heart disease</a>; obesity also contributes to the development of diabetes, as well as a host of other health conditions, including cancers.

<strong>Sugar and Reduction of Nutrient Intake</strong>

Candy contains no vitamins or nutrients. Filling up on high-calorie candies leaves less room for nourishment from nutrient-dense foods. Sugar consumption also leaches other nutrients, such as calcium, from the body. This leads to a number of deficiencies, including iron, vitamin A and vitamin C, and contributing to osteoporosis, anemia, and lowered immunity.

<strong>Sugar and Compromised Digestion</strong>

Candies like gummies, Twizzlers, or fruit chews contain none of the fiber which helps foods move through the digestive tract. Binging on these types of treats can lead to an upset stomach, and a backed up GI tract.

<strong>A Healthier Approach to Sugar</strong>

Commit to limiting your intake of candies this year. Better yet, avoid the the traditional Halloween treats entirely, and opt for <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/homemade-granola-bars/\">healthier substitutions</a>. Don’t buy those bags of mini candy bars once they go on sale, and if you really struggle with sugar, be sure not to keep it in your house. If you want to indulge a bit, have a few squares of <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/slideshow/1011272-12-clean-dark-chocolate-bars/#slide=5\">organic dark chocolate</a> of 70 percent cacao or higher. Learn to enjoy a few bites of something sweet in moderation, without going off the deep end into a full-blown binge. When you do want to enjoy a treat, select whole, natural products with the highest quality ingredients you can find, and enjoy them after a full day of eating a wholesome, balanced diet. Many companies are creating <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2015/10/a_comprehensive_review_of_healthy_candy.html\">healthier candies</a> these days; while they may be more expensive, taking steps to protect your and your family’s health is worth it.

4805,1,"2018-02-20 08:00:13","2018-02-20 08:00:13","It's vital to stay fit, as the <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-exercise/\">benefits of exercise</a> are countless. It promotes longevity, boosts cognitive function, and supports a vigorous immune system and overall wellness. Combined with a healthy diet, a lifelong commitment to exercise is one of the surest ways to stay healthy as you get older.

While some forms of exercise are doable at any age, modifications based on life stage are important. Your needs and abilities change over time, and while a good exercise regimen will benefit you no matter when you start, like any investment, the sooner the better. Here are some tips in order to stay fit at any age.

<strong>Exercise for Children and Teens</strong>

Childhood is the perfect time to encourage play and an active lifestyle, building the foundation for good lifelong habits. <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/exercise.html\">Kids who are physically active</a> have stronger muscles and bones, leaner bodies, decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and other chronic conditions, and better confidence and mental health. Young children and teens have a variety of fitness options available to them, such as dance, swimming, martial arts, school sports, and outdoor games. Fitness guidelines for children and teens recommend:
<ul>
 	<li>Keeping periods of inactivity (besides sleeping) to under two hours at a time</li>
 	<li>Vigorous activity for a minimum of one hour per day</li>
</ul>
<strong>Stay Fit During Your 20s</strong>

This is the perfect time to establish a daily fitness and nutrition routine, especially post-college. If you have good fitness habits in place, continue with those sports and activities you already love doing. This is the decade to emphasize cardiovascular fitness, which supports your long-term health as you get older. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate cardio exercise five days per week, or 25 minutes of intense cardio three days per week.

<strong>Stay Fit During Your 30s</strong>

This is the decade to emphasize core strength, especially if you plan to get pregnant, and add <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/interval-training/art-20044588\">interval training</a> to your cardio routine to counteract a slowing metabolism. This is also the time to shore up and maintain your muscle mass, as most people lose muscle as they age. Weight training, weight-bearing yoga postures, Pilates, and anything that works to strengthen and build your muscles is a must.

<strong>Stay Fit During Your 40s</strong>

If you are already in great shape, this is an excellent time to increase your activity and take your fitness up a notch. The more exercise the better — this will protect your muscle mass, as well as your telomeres, which are stretches of DNA that promote longevity and cellular health. Alternate between moderate and vigorous cardiovascular exercise, and continue weight training. Bike, take long, brisk walks, hike, or take a fun new fitness class. The key is to keep moving, and stay active. If you are new to the fitness game, jump in - your body will respond beautifully, and you will feel and look better than ever.

<strong>Stay Fit During Your 50s</strong>

Lowered estrogen and fluctuating hormone levels due to menopause can lead to mood dysregulation and potential bone loss. Exercise is excellent for stabilizing moods, and weight-bearing exercises are vital to maintaining muscle and bone mass. Aim for 30 minutes of daily weight-bearing exercise, such as yoga, dancing, tennis, jogging, or weight training. This is also the decade to focus on protecting leg and lower body strength. Research shows a connection between <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/health-34764693\">leg strength and brain health</a> as we age. The mechanism isn’t fully understood, but one theory posits that brain-stimulating neurochemicals are released when muscles are worked, and leg muscles are some of the largest in the body. Regardless, physical exercise that improves brain health is doubly important to pursue.

<strong>Stay Fit During Your 60s and Beyond</strong>

The healthier and more fit you’ve been up to this point, the better. Make adjustments as your body requires — don’t ignore illness, pains, or signs of distress. But there is no need to slow down if you still feel good. Keep moving and stay active. The better shape you're in, the greater your vitality as you age. While weight gain is common after menopause, it's still possible to drop extra pounds and trim your belly at this life stage. It's also important to sustain excellent cardiovascular health, and to reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes and various cancers. Light aerobic activity, regular brisk walks, and gardening are all great options to stay fit. <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/dumbbell-strength-training-for-seniors-3498669\">Strength training</a> continues to be important in these years, so try to do a full body workout with medium weights for about 40 minutes twice a week in addition to cardio activities.

4848,1,"2017-11-03 17:08:50","2017-11-03 17:08:50","Sleep deprivation has many negative short-term effects. It often makes us irritable and less productive the next day. It undermines concentration and slows our reaction time. We usually feel it when we didn't <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/how_to_keep_good_sleep_hygiene/\">get enough sleep</a> and need to catch up the following night.

But chronic sleep deprivation has long-term effects that could be even more significant. Routinely failing to get adequate sleep, whether due to a condition like insomnia or just life circumstances, has a cumulative impact on brain functioning and elevates risks for mental health issues like anxiety and depression.

<strong>Sleep Deprivation: Cause or Effect of Mental Health Problems?</strong>

The medical community has long wrestled with the chicken-or-the-egg relationship between sleep loss and mental health. After all, there's a vicious cycle at work. When we're anxious, for instance, it's harder to get quality sleep, which then only increases our level of anxiety. And the overlap between poor sleep habits and psychological distress is so prevalent, it can be difficult to unpack which leads to which.

Chronic sleep problems <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/sleep-and-mental-health\">are said to affect</a> 50% to 80% of psychiatric patients, compared with just 10% to 18% of adults in the general U.S. population. The relationship between insomnia and mental illness is frequently described as \"bidirectional.\" Sleep issues and mental health problems also <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Related-Conditions/Sleep-Disorders\">exacerbate each other</a>, creating situations where it's increasingly difficult to treat both.

<strong>Sleep Deprivation and Mental Health Risks</strong>

While causation is often tricky to decipher with mental health problems, a growing body of research indicates that sleep deprivation is a strong predictor of mood disorders. <a href=\"http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/need-sleep/whats-in-it-for-you/mood\">In one study</a>, people with chronic insomnia were five times more likely to develop depression and 20 times more likely to develop a panic disorder.

Experts have found that in sleep-deprived patients, the amygdala, a part of the brain that processes emotion, becomes \"rewired\" in a way that reduces our rational response to external events. These individuals have <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-a-lack-of-sleep-cause/\">big emotional swings</a>, going from upset to giddy in moments. Sleep deprivation can even create symptoms similar to those of schizophrenia.

The strongest link, however, is between insomnia and depression. In a number of studies, insomnia represented a \"substantial risk\" for the development of depressive disorders. Encouragingly, investigators have discovered that individuals with depression who improve their sleep experience a faster response from antidepressants. Experts have found that cognitive behavior therapy designed to treat insomnia has the effect of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26827250\">reducing depression symptoms</a>.

<strong>How to Fight Sleep Deprivation</strong>

For severe cases of lasting and intractable insomnia, individuals should consult with a physician. But for many people, countering sleep deprivation is simply a matter of committing to improved sleep hygiene. Taking sleep seriously and making a few adjustments to your nightly routine is often enough to get back on track. And returning to adequate sleep is a preventive tool against depression and other mental health issues.

Proper sleep hygiene has many components, but among the most important steps you can take:
<ul>
 	<li>Go to bed and wake up at the same times every day to put your body on a schedule.</li>
 	<li>Keep your bedroom dark and not using electronics once there; the light emitted by screens confuses your body's internal clock.</li>
 	<li>Exercise — regular physical activity has innumerable health benefits, including the facilitation of sleep patterns.</li>
 	<li>Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine in the hours before bed whenever possible.</li>
 	<li>Get natural light during the day, especially in the morning.</li>
</ul>
Sleep deprivation doesn't just make you grumpy. Over time, it can lead to mental health issues and other medical problems. Addressing chronic sleeplessness before it starts to affect your daily life is a major piece of good preventive self-care.

Diabetes mellitus refers to a cluster of diseases that impact how the body utilizes blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is a vital energy source for the brain, as well as the cells that make up our tissues and muscles. But diabetes leads to too much glucose in the blood. A preventive lifestyle, including a whole foods, <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/diet-plans/plant-based-diet/\">plant-centered diet</a>, and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-exercise/\">regular exercise</a>, is integral to maintaining healthy blood sugar. Diabetes symptoms can take many forms, but good health practices can mitigate most of them.

<strong>Kinds of Diabetes </strong>

Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are different versions of the disease. Type 1 diabetes, also called juvenile diabetes, occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin, meaning the body cannot regulate glucose. This type cannot be prevented and usually develops during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, which is more common, involves insulin resistance. Their bodies don't utilize insulin as they should, leading to problems managing glucose. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle changes around nutrition and exercise.

Prediabetes occurs when your blood sugar is higher than normal, but is not yet high enough to qualify as diabetes. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy, but can be resolved after the baby's delivery.

<strong>Diabetes Symptoms</strong>

Due to poor <a href=\"http://www.wholehealthandnutrition.com/article.php?article=29\">diets filled with processed foods</a> and refined sugars, as well as sedentary lifestyles, diabetes is a growing health concern across a wider range of Americans than ever before.

Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how high your blood glucose levels are. In Type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to be severe, with a more rapid onset, while those with Type 2 and prediabetes may not experience symptoms at first, or they may be somewhat mild. Women with gestational diabetes may have no symptoms, so tests are required at certain stages of pregnancy. Below are some signs and symptoms of diabetes you should be aware of:
<ul>
 	<li>An increase in thirst</li>
 	<li>Rapid weight loss</li>
 	<li>Excessive hunger</li>
 	<li>Slow wound healing</li>
 	<li>Dry or cracked skin</li>
 	<li>Frequent yeast infections in women</li>
 	<li>Numbness in the extremities</li>
 	<li>Frequent urination</li>
 	<li>Changes or impairments in vision</li>
 	<li>Chronic or extreme fatigue</li>
 	<li>Sweet smelling urine</li>
</ul>
Early detection of diabetes symptoms and treatment can reduce the risk of complications. Diabetes increases your risk for various health problems, but with recommended lifestyle changes and effective treatment, many people are able to delay or prevent complications from occurring. Complications from diabetes include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Skin Complications </strong>- Stay alert for signs of bacterial infections such as styes (infections of the eyelid glands), boils, and folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicles), as well as fungal infections like Candida albicans.</li>
 	<li><strong>Eye Complications </strong>- Keep up with regular checkups to reduce your risk of cataracts, glaucoma, and other eye conditions.</li>
 	<li><strong>Neuropathy </strong>- Diabetic nerve damage occurs in about half of all people living with diabetes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Kidney Disease </strong>- Keeping diabetes and blood pressure under control will lower the risk of kidney disease (nephropathy).</li>
 	<li><strong>Stroke</strong> - Maintain healthy cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose to reduce risk of stroke.</li>
 	<li><strong>High Blood Pressure </strong>- Also called hypertension, high blood pressure raises your risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and eye complications.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Diabetes Awareness and Prevention</strong>

Type 1 diabetes can’t be prevented, but the same <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/advocacy/advocacy-priorities/prevention/?referrer=https://search.yahoo.com/\">preventive lifestyle adjustments</a> used to treat gestational and Type 2 diabetes, can also help prevent symptoms from developing. Remember that preventive lifestyle adjustments are for everyone; not just those managing diabetes. A fresh, whole foods diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and keeping up with regular exercise are all key to maintaining health, and reducing your risk of chronic illnesses in the long term.

4879,1,"2017-11-06 22:24:45","2017-11-06 22:24:45","You may think that receiving a diagnosis of insulin resistance or prediabetes is a guarantee you will develop Type 2 <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/diabetes-symptoms/\">diabetes</a>, but that's not the case. Insulin resistance and prediabetes are very responsive to <a href=\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/781160\">lifestyle and dietary adjustments</a>. Things like weight loss, improved nutrition, and regular exercise can help your blood glucose levels considerably.

<strong>What is Insulin Resistance?</strong>

Insulin is a hormone created by the pancreas. Insulin resistance occurs when cells in your muscles, liver, and body fat begin to resist (ignore) the signal that insulin sends out, alerting them to remove excess glucose from the blood stream. These tissues depend upon insulin to stay properly nourished; they are limited in their ability to draw glucose from the bloodstream on their own. If all systems are working as they should, blood sugar stays in balance, and the body’s muscles and tissues are well fed by the excess glucose drawn from the bloodstream.

Prediabetes occurs when glucose in the bloodstream is high, but not yet high enough to be classified as diabetes. Insulin resistance, prediabetes, and Type 2 diabetes can be managed, and <a href=\"http://www.masteringdiabetes.org/\">in many cases reversed</a>, by the right lifestyle changes. Medication may also be prescribed.

<strong>Reversing Insulin Resistance</strong>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Choose a Whole Foods Diet</strong> - Try to eat complex carbohydrates. Eliminate refined and processed starches, as well as industrially produced fats (trans fats) and processed foods, from your diet. Some good choices are vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. Complex carbohydrates are more complex on a molecular level, and take longer for the body to break down. This means they absorb more slowly, helping to keep blood glucose levels stable. Complex carbs will also help you feel fuller longer, and help with weight and appetite control. Aim to eat a whole foods, plant-based diet whenever possible.</li>
 	<li><strong>Eliminate Sugary Drinks and Simple Carbohydrates </strong>- Simple sugars alone don’t cause diabetes, but they do contribute to insulin resistance and overall poor health. High fructose corn syrup is a particularly bad offender. Avoid simple carbohydrates that contain glucose, fructose, and sucrose, such as candies, cakes, soft drinks, and added sugars and sweeteners. Learn to read food labels — you'll discover that processed foods and sweets tend to be loaded with added sugars.</li>
 	<li><strong>Increase Fiber Intake </strong>- Research shows that eating insoluble fiber along with whole grains and complex carbohydrates reduces the risk of Type 2 diabetes. Aim to eat some insoluble fiber with each meal. Good sources include:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li>Fresh fruits: pears, apples, prunes, dried figs</li>
 	<li>Nuts and seeds</li>
 	<li>Vegetables: leafy greens, squashes, peas</li>
 	<li>Berries</li>
 	<li>Whole grains: brown rice, quinoa, oats</li>
 	<li>Beans: Lentils, navy beans, kidney beans</li>
</ul>
<strong>Other Key Strategies</strong>

In addition to dietary changes, it is important to increase your activity and fitness level in order to manage and reverse insulin resistance and prediabetes. Choose a physical activity you enjoy doing, and commit to at least three days per week. Moderate <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/fitness/types-of-activity/what-we-recommend.html?referrer=https://search.yahoo.com/\">exercise</a> is best, such as a brisk 30-minute walk each day, yoga, or tai chi. Combine cardio exercise with strength training or weight bearing exercise. Consider whether you prefer working out alone, with a partner, or if you’d enjoy a <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/join-adult-recreational-sports-team/\">group sport</a>. Also, add in some simple ways to get more active, like taking the stairs or including stretch breaks throughout the day.

November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month, and it's important to learn what you can do to reduce your risk and stay healthy.

The disease refers to uncontrolled abnormal cell growth on one or both lungs. These cells don't carry out the functions of healthy lung tissue. Instead, as they grow, these abnormalities form tumors, which interfere with the lungs’ ability to supply oxygen to the body through the bloodstream.

<strong>Types of Lung Cancer</strong>

There are three types of lung cancer.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Small cell lung cancer</strong> - Also called oat cell cancer, small cell lung cancer tends to spread rapidly, and comprises about 10 to 15 percent of all lung cancers diagnosed.</li>
 	<li><strong>Non-small cell lung cancer </strong>- This is the most common type of lung cancer, with about 85 percent of all diagnosed lung cancers being the non-small cell variation. Large cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma are subtypes of this form of lung cancer.</li>
 	<li><strong>Lung carcinoid tumor </strong>- This is a rare form of lung cancer. Only about 5 percent of lung cancers are lung carcinoid tumors; these are also known as neuroendocrine tumors. They tend to grow slowly, and do not usually spread.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Treatment of Lung Cancer</strong>

Treatment options for the different types of lung cancer vary, with each kind requiring a different approach. Each type is often treated using a combination of modalities, and <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/non-small-cell-lung-cancer/treating/palliative.html\">palliative care treatments</a> are frequently used to decrease discomfort.

For small cell lung cancer include, treatments include:
<ul>
 	<li>Chemotherapy</li>
 	<li>Surgery</li>
 	<li>Radiation therapy</li>
</ul>
Multiple types of treatments may be used to manage small cell lung cancer, with chemotherapy and radiation being the most common. Surgery is sometimes used, but is more rare with this type of cancer.

Treatment for non-small cell lung cancer includes:
<ul>
 	<li>Surgery</li>
 	<li>Radiation therapy</li>
 	<li>Immunotherapy</li>
 	<li>Targeted therapies</li>
 	<li>Radiofrequency ablation</li>
</ul>
Lung carcinoid tumors are treated with:
<ul>
 	<li>Drug treatments</li>
 	<li>Radiation therapy</li>
 	<li>Chemotherapy</li>
 	<li>Surgery</li>
</ul>
<strong>Lung Cancer Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention</strong>

Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in the United States. Most cases are caused by smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. About 80 percent of all lung cancers are caused by tobacco smoke, and secondhand smoke alone causes about 7,000 deaths each year. Prevention includes steps you can take to lower your risk. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors helps reduce your risk of developing chronic illness and disease.

<strong>Risk Factors for Lung Cancer</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Tobacco/cigarette, pipe, and cigar smoking</li>
 	<li>Secondhand smoke</li>
 	<li>Environmental risk factors like pollution or asbestos</li>
 	<li>HIV infection</li>
 	<li>Family history</li>
 	<li>Beta-carotene supplementation in heavy smokers</li>
</ul>
<strong>Lung Cancer Protective Factors</strong><strong> </strong>

The following protective measures can help reduce your risk:
<ul>
 	<li>Do not smoke</li>
 	<li>If you do smoke, quit</li>
 	<li>Avoid or lower exposure to environmental risk factors</li>
 	<li>Reduce or avoid exposure to radon and radiation</li>
 	<li>Eat well and exercise</li>
</ul>
<strong>Lung Cancer Prevention </strong>

Not all lung cancers can be prevented, per se, but you can reduce your chances of developing these illnesses by decreasing your exposure to controllable risk factors. The most important thing you can do is avoid smoking or breathing in other people’s smoke. If you stop smoking before you develop lung cancer, your lung tissue gradually repairs itself, and you lower your risk of becoming sick. No matter your age or how long you’ve smoked, quitting will reduce your risk, and help you live a longer, healthier life overall. Radon is also a major cause of lung cancers, so have your home tested and treated (if needed).

<strong>Exercise and Eat a Healthy Diet</strong>

<a href=\"http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/prevention-and-healthy-living/food-and-cancer-prevention/1\">A whole foods, plant-centered diet</a> with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables may also help you avoid lung cancer. Studies suggest that plant-based diets (<a href=\"http://www.aicr.org/cancer-research-update/2016/05_18/cru-More-Evidence-of-Exercise-for-Cancer-Prevention.html?referrer=https://search.yahoo.com/\">especially when combined with exercise</a>) are protective in both smokers and non-smokers, though not smoking, or quitting smoking, is still crucial for preventing illness and vulnerability to chronic diseases. A focus on creating wellness, and overall quality of life, is the best investment you can make in your health. Giving up poor habits and dietary choices, and establishing new and better habits, isn’t always easy, but it is always worth your efforts.

4900,1,"2017-11-09 14:44:08","2017-11-09 14:44:08","<strong>What is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?</strong>

In addition to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/lung-cancer/\">lung cancer</a>, November is National Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Awareness Month. COPD is an inflammatory lung disease that impairs airflow. When we breathe, the air travels through tubes (called airways) to millions of tiny air sacs in our lungs. In healthy lungs, these passages are open and unobstructed, allowing air to flow in and out quickly. COPD impedes this process. Emphysema and bronchitis are the two conditions most <a href=\"https://www.copd.com\">commonly associated</a> with COPD.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Bronchitis </strong>- An inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from the alveoli, or air sacs, of the lungs. It is characterized by daily, chronic coughing and mucus production.</li>
 	<li><strong>Emphysema </strong>- An inflammatory condition in which the air sacs of the lungs are destroyed as a result of damaging exposure to cigarette smoke, industrial pollutants, and other irritating gases and substances. With emphysema, the smallest breathing tubes in the lungs may also collapse, in addition to the damage done to the alveoli.</li>
</ul>
<strong>What Causes COPD?</strong><strong> </strong>

Cigarette smoking <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/diseases/copd.html\">causes about 80 to 90 percent</a> of all cases. Habitual smoking inflames the lining of the airways of the lungs, and destroys their elasticity. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, environmental pollutants, and occupational dust or contaminants/chemicals. If you have asthma and smoke, this further increases your chances of developing these diseases. Heredity may also play a role. Researchers have identified what is known as an alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, but this genetic disorder contributes to only a small number of COPD cases (about one percent).

<strong>Symptoms</strong><strong> </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Shortness of breath</li>
 	<li>Difficulty breathing when lying down, or with exertion</li>
 	<li>Wheezing</li>
 	<li>Chest tightness</li>
 	<li>Frequent respiratory infections</li>
 	<li>Fatigue and lack of energy</li>
 	<li>Swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet</li>
 	<li>A chronic cough that produces sputum (mucus) that may be clear, white, greenish, or yellow in color</li>
 	<li>Cyanosis, which is blueness of the lips or fingernail beds</li>
 	<li>Unintended weight loss</li>
 	<li>Frequent colds and flu</li>
</ul>
COPD is often characterized by exacerbations, or periods of several days when symptoms become worse than usual. It is a progressive disease, tending to worsen over time. That is why it is vitally important to seek treatment quickly, so the illness can be managed and addressed as soon as possible. Lifestyle adjustments are a key component to any COPD treatment plan.

<strong>Possible Complications</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Respiratory infections. Those with COPD are more likely to catch colds, flu, and pneumonia.</li>
 	<li>Heart problems. COPD can increase your risk of heart disease and heart attacks.</li>
 	<li>High blood pressure in lung arteries. COPD may cause pulmonary hypertension, or high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to the lungs.</li>
 	<li>Difficulty breathing, combined with restricted activities due to illness, can contribute to depression. Seek help if you begin to experience feelings of prolonged helplessness or sadness.</li>
 	<li>Lung cancer. People with COPD have a higher risk for lung cancer.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Prevention</strong>

The best thing you can do to prevent COPD is to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672326/\">never smoke</a>. <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/quick_thought_smoking_cessation/\">If you do smoke, quit</a>. Quitting can improve your health, no matter how long you’ve smoked. When you quit smoking, you slow down the damage being done to your lungs, and they begin to repair themselves. For people who quit smoking, lung function can improve dramatically, and over time is on par with those who do not smoke. It is also important to avoid contaminated air, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/cleaning-products-may-increase-risk-201816610.html\">chemicals</a>, or pollutants, as much as possible.

And the version we make is even healthier, since we've removed the processed sugar and refined ingredients included in traditional recipes. The result is a wholesome gluten-free banana bread you'll love!
<p class=\"gmail-p1\"><a href=\"https://eheintl.com/healthy-snacks/\">Bananas</a> are the perfect base for baked goods, since they keep bread moist without needing excessive amounts of oil or butter. They also contain many important nutrients. Additionally, they're full of <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/digestive_health_fiber/\">fiber</a>, which helps slow the digestion of sugar into the bloodstream. One banana also contains more than a third of our daily vitamin B6 requirement. B vitamins are crucial for metabolism, energy, a well-functioning nervous system, and skin health. B6, specifically, improves brain function, facilitates the manufacturing of hemoglobin, and is good for healthy immune function. It also helps to maintain a positive mood, since it factors in the production of serotonin.<span class=\"gmail-Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>
<p class=\"gmail-p1\">For fat, we've chosen <a href=\"https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/other/ghee-clarified-butter.html\">ghee</a> (with the option of using coconut oil if you're vegan). Ghee is a form of clarified butter — meaning the milk proteins are removed, but the vitamins stay intact (unlike commercially produced butter). Ghee is full of Omega-3 and Omega-9 fatty acids; it's also one of the best sources of conjugated linoleic acid, which has anti-cancer properties. Since the milk proteins are removed from ghee, many individuals with dairy sensitivities find that they can tolerate it well, making it the perfect substitute for our gluten-free banana bread recipe!<span class=\"gmail-Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>
<p class=\"gmail-p1\">We've created a slight twist by adding raw <a href=\"https://begoodorganics.com/blogs/subscriber-only-recipes/7991527-cacao-5-little-known-benefits-of-this-amazonian-superfood\">cacao</a> to the mix. This gives our gluten-free banana bread a rich chocolate flavor, so you'll feel like you're eating dessert! The antioxidant levels in cacao are incredibly high — 40 times higher than blueberries, in fact. It's also rich in iron, making it an excellent dietary addition for vegans and vegetarians who don't consume iron-rich animal products. You'll find more calcium in cacao than in dairy milk, which is good for preventing osteoporosis and helpful for growing children and teens. And cacao also has calming properties, since it's so rich in magnesium, which is often touted as the \"relaxation mineral\" since it helps steady nerves, reduces anxiety, and may help people with insomnia.<span class=\"gmail-Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>

4922,1,"2017-11-13 16:06:12","2017-11-13 16:06:12","Peanut allergy has become a more widespread and <a href=\"http://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/peanut-allergy\">serious health issue</a> in recent years. In fact, the incidence of peanut allergy among American children has increased 21 percent in the last seven years, according to a new report.

EHE's Chief Medical Officer, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/chief-medical-officer-tania-elliott/\">Dr. Tania Elliott</a>, recently appeared on \"Good Morning America\" to discuss the spike in peanut allergy diagnoses and how new research indicates that the best way to prevent peanut allergy may be to introduce peanuts to children at a younger age.

As Dr. Elliott explained, \"Parents were told not to introduce peanuts to kids until they were over the age of two. So when you wait that long, and all of a sudden the immune system is exposed to something brand new, it says, 'This is something foreign,' and it develops an allergic response to it.\"

She then referred to a compelling new study of children at high risk for developing peanut allergy. In the study, half of the subjects were exposed to peanuts at an earlier age, while the other half were first given peanuts after the traditional two-year delay. It turned out that while 17 percent of the children in the delayed group developed a peanut allergy, only 2 percent of the children in the early exposure group did.

In fact, new medical guidelines support the \"early introduction\" approach with children and peanuts. And while nothing fully guarantees peanut allergy prevention, it does appear to lower the chances of developing the common allergy.

4933,1,"2017-11-14 07:00:17","2017-11-14 07:00:17","Making a healthy pumpkin pie can be tricky. While pumpkin on its own has great nutritional value, the traditional Thanksgiving dessert we know is <a href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Many-Calories-Pumpkin-Pie-36285836\">filled with</a> sugar, dairy, and processed wheat — a far cry from clean eating. This year, we’ve switched to a gluten-free crust, clean sugars, and organic pumpkin for a version that’s just as tasty but <em>much</em> healthier.

We’ve chosen a store-bought crust to make preparation of this healthy pumpkin pie simpler, although making your own crust is, of course, always an option. Using a gluten-free or whole grain crust helps ensure that the dessert will be free from refined starches that lead to a spike in blood sugar. It's preferable to pick an option with <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/digestive_health_fiber/\">fiber</a>, which will slow the absorption of sugar into the blood while also aiding digestion. Fiber promotes a feeling of fullness and helps to prevent overeating. Additionally, it helps feed good gut bacteria, improves immunity, and removes excess hormones like estrogen.

We’ve given you the option to use canned pumpkin for this pie; if possible, choose organic, pure pumpkin. It makes the dessert more dense in nutrients. You’ll see other canned options called something like “pumpkin pie filling,” so be sure to check that pumpkin is the only listed ingredient. In addition to the fiber found in a properly chosen crust, one can of pumpkin adds seven grams of fiber.

Pumpkin, like most brightly-colored orange, yellow, and red produce, is rich in beta-carotene, a nutrient which the body converts to Vitamin A. Vitamin A is important for eye health, reproductive function, and immunity. If you’ve chosen a fresh pumpkin, be sure to save the seeds. They are rich in potassium, magnesium, and zinc. They have also been shown to contain properties that fight off certain chronic diseases like cancer.

The fat found in coconut milk is useful in absorbing nutrients like Vitamin A. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are all fat soluble, meaning they require fat in order for the body to absorb and utilize them. Pairing foods containing these nutrients with fats found in coconut, avocado, olive oil, and raw nuts (to name a few), is important. It’s also a reason to avoid diets extremely low in fat. They can result in vitamin deficiencies and a slew of other ailments in the body.

So... let's make healthy pumpkin pie!

4935,1,"2017-11-14 11:02:01","2017-11-14 11:02:01","Gluten-free stuffing is becoming more mainstream as more people give up gluten. Some individuals (like those with celiac disease) can get very sick if they eat it. Other people may have more mild intolerances or sensitivities to gluten. Others go <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/healthy-blueberry-muffins/\">gluten-free</a> because they find it keeps their skin more clear, improves digestion, gives them more energy, and is otherwise a positive for their health.

<strong>What Exactly Is Gluten?</strong>

Gluten refers to the glutenin and gliadin proteins found in any wheat, rye, or barley products. It's responsible for the sticky texture of wheat-based dough, and gives bread the chewy texture that we all love. People with celiac disease can't process gluten, which activates their immune response. This leads the body to attack not only the gluten, but also the digestive system, causing horrible stomach cramping and longer-term consequences.

Some without celiac disease experience intolerance on a milder scale, with bloating, stomach aches, digestion issues, breakouts, mood decline, and energy slumps. If you suspect you have an intolerance to gluten, doing an elimination diet (removing all allergins for 2-3 weeks, then slowly adding suspected allergins one at a time) can be helpful in determining your personal response to gluten and other foods like dairy.

Even if your body does tolerate gluten, try to choose organic, whole grain products with no added sugar. Preferably, wheat products are sprouted, which makes the nutrients found in grains more accessible to the human body.

<strong>The Gluten-Free Stuffing Solution</strong>

If you do decide to go gluten-free, it can be challenging to miss out on foods you once loved. Especially around the holidays, when baked goods and classic holiday recipes are abundant, it's easy to feel like something's lacking. We've created this gluten-free stuffing recipe to help you enjoy the full Thanksgiving spread. Not only is this recipe full of flavor, but it comes with a variety of health benefits.

We've included antioxidant-rich produce like carrots, onions, apples, and celery. We've also chosen wholesome fats like ghee and olive oil, and plenty of herbs to add both flavor and nutrients.

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

1.5 loaves gluten-free bread (preferably a sourdough variety like Udi's)
4 fresh sage leaves
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 cups bone broth or turkey broth*
3-4 large carrots, sliced
1 apple, chopped
2 celery stock, sliced
1 small yellow onion, chopped
3-4 cloves garlic, minced
2 eggs
1/2 cup ghee*
1/4 cup olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

*To make this recipe vegan, use vegetable broth and replace ghee with olive oil

<strong>Step 1: Preheat oven to 225. Grease a casserole dish. Cut bread into large bite-size pieces. Spread bread cubes onto a baking sheet. Bake for 45 minutes, to dry out bread.</strong>

<strong>Step 2: While bread bakes, cut vegetables. Heat ghee and olive oil over medium, cook onion for three minutes. Add carrots and celery and cook for another for five minutes. Next add apple, garlic, herbs, and salt and pepper, then cook for an additional three minutes. Set aside.</strong>

<strong>Step 3: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk eggs and broth together. Toss in bread. Let the bread sit in the egg-broth mixture, tossing every five minutes until the mixture has fully soaked all of the bread (this is important to avoid dry stuffing). Once the bread is soaked, toss with vegetables and pour into a casserole dish.</strong>

<strong>Step 4: Cover stuffing and bake for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until top is golden brown. Now it's time to serve your gluten-free stuffing!</strong>

4974,1,"2017-11-27 08:00:27","2017-11-27 08:00:27","<strong>How to Practice Mindful Eating</strong>

In a broad sense, <a href=\"https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/mindfulness/definition\">mindfulness</a> is simply taking notice of your thoughts, behaviors, and habits. Mindful eating <a href=\"https://www.thecenterformindfuleating.org\">means</a> we take our time to eat, observe when we are hungry and when we feel full, and pay attention to what we eat and where it comes from. Mindful eating means we understand that <em>how</em> we eat is an important consideration, just like <em>what</em> we eat.

Here are five ways to establish mindful eating habits:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Listen to your body</strong><strong>. </strong>In our frenetically paced culture, we often lose track of the fundamentals of eating. Pay attention to your physical hunger signals, and observe when your body feels full. Often, we eat too rapidly and ignore when our bodies say it's time to stop. Slowing down is the best way to ensure our bodies have the chance to express <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/nutritionfactslabel/\">nutritional needs</a>, and it also makes eating more enjoyable.</li>
 	<li><strong>Turn off the phone and TV. </strong>Make your personal and family meals as distraction-free as possible. Try to eat at the same established times each day. Make space for some quiet time at the dinner table. Keep conversation as gentle, joyful, and stress-free as you can. If you do decide to have movie nights with dinner in front of the TV, do so consciously, and perhaps only on weekends.</li>
 	<li><strong>Savor your food. </strong>Pay attention to all the things you love about your meal — the textures, colors, and flavors. Allow yourself to focus t0tally on the experience. Slow down, breathe, and give yourself the time to fully enjoy your food. Not only will your pleasure in eating increase, you will <a href=\"https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/mindfulness-helps-us-digest-and-enjoy-our-food\">digest and assimilate your meal better</a></li>
 	<li><strong>Know your food and where it comes from. </strong>Choose the highest quality fresh and natural foods you can afford. Engage yourself in the meal-making process. Do you know who grew your food and where it originated? Maybe you can find a local market or bakery where you interact with the people who supply your ingredients. A simple appreciation for the food you eat can increase your enjoyment exponentially. And the more mindful you are about the <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/healthyeating/\">quality of foods</a> you and your family eat (and where they come from), the more likely you are to make better choices.</li>
 	<li><strong>Balance food as comfort with nutritional needs. </strong><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/inside-out/201309/emotional-eating-5-reasons-you-can-t-stop\">Sometimes we eat to fulfill emotional needs</a>, rather than considering the quality or nutritional value of our meal. Healthy, natural foods can be prepared in ways that provide plenty of enjoyment and comfort <em>without</em> sacrificing nutrition. Mindful eating leads you to eat what you want, but in a higher quality and cleaner way. The more fresh foods you eat, the better they will taste to you.</li>
</ol>
With mindful eating, we train ourselves to pay closer attention to our bodies' real needs. The process of cooking and eating should be a pleasure — but it also needs to be nourishing. The more deliberate and conscious we are, the more we get out of it.

4976,1,"2017-11-20 08:00:39","2017-11-20 08:00:39","Overeating is a persistent, year-round problem for many people, but it's particularly dangerous as we enter the holiday season and winter months, when our lives tend to get more sedentary and comfort food is more prevalent. We may find our cravings for carbohydrate-rich foods and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sugar/\">sweets</a> increasing, and <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/conditions/sad\">if we struggle</a> with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), those impulses can intensify.

As the days darken and the holidays approach, how can we keep our eating under control? Here are some tips for navigating the temptation to binge.

<strong>Why Portion Control Matters</strong>

Overeating taxes the body and digestive system. It can thwart efforts to keep weight within a healthy range. With the all-too-pervasive trend of the “super-sized” meal, all-you-can-eat buffets, and exaggerated “single serving” portions of chips, snacks, and candy bars, we tend to lose sight of what healthy eating actually looks like. Portion control is about eating the right amount for your body at a given time in order to optimize digestion and keep healthy.

<strong>Listen to Your Body</strong>

By learning to <a href=\"https://www.mindful.org/6-ways-practice-mindful-eating/\">listen to our bodies</a> and adopting a mindful approach to eating, we can more accurately assess signals of hunger and satiation. Overeating is often tied to unmet emotional needs, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/symptoms-of-stress/\">too much stress</a>, or other moments when we seek comfort. Typically, these foods are high in salt, fat, and sugar, which tend to trigger the urge to overeat.

Indulging every now and then is fine. After all, eating delicious food is a pleasure. But regularly eating to excess, especially with nutritionally empty food, is a short-term solution to unresolved stress or distress. This is especially common during the holidays, when family and financial tensions may be high. Learn to slow down, tune in, and pay attention to how you feel when you eat.

<strong>What Does a Healthy Portion Look Like?</strong>

Be (very) wary of the super-sizing trend. Even the muffins and bagels at your local coffee shop may be surprisingly high in calories and sugar, and super-sized sodas and fast food meals are, quite simply, dangerous for your health. Consider that you may need to reorient your idea of what a normal, healthy portion of food looks like:
<ul>
 	<li>medium potato — the size of a computer mouse</li>
 	<li>serving of brown rice, whole grains, or mashed potatoes — the size of half a baseball</li>
 	<li>whole grain muffin — the size of a tennis ball</li>
 	<li>8 oz portion of meat — the size of a thin paperback book</li>
 	<li>3 oz portion of meat — the size of a deck of cards (this is the recommended portion for one meal)</li>
</ul>
One rule of thumb for creating a balanced plate is to fill half of it with leafy greens and vegetables, a quarter with your protein of choice, and the remaining quarter with a starchy carbohydrate. (Of course, dietary needs vary.)

<strong>Strategize for Parties and Events</strong>

Whether you have a family party, office gathering, or holiday dinner to attend, make it a point to curb your hunger beforehand with a light snack. That way, you can enjoy the festivities and indulge (a little), without overdoing things. <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/healthy-snacks/\">Healthy snacks</a> include things like half of a cup of almonds and one piece of fruit, one sliced apple with two tablespoons of your favorite nut butter, or a few slices of organic cheese.

<strong>When Eating Out</strong>

Remember that when you eat out, you are typically being served at least twice as much as your body needs for any given meal. If possible, avoid large or super-sized portions. Opt for a salad at your favorite restaurant, and share an entree with a friend. Or you can eat half your meal, and take the remaining portion home for lunch the next day. Also, drink pure or sparkling water instead of sodas. Limit your intake of alcoholic beverages — or better yet, avoid them entirely.

<strong>When You Indulge, Don’t Overdo it</strong>

Taking care of your body and watching your portions means you can enjoy some dark chocolate, a glass of wine, or a scoop of your favorite ice cream now and then. If you make treats totally off limits, or adhere to overly strict dieting standards (especially during the holidays), you run the risk of a deprivation-induced binge. The holiday season tends to add to our already heavy stress loads, so be gentle with yourself, but make your health a priority. Stick to a fitness program, and load up on healthy foods, leafy greens, and fresh fruits and vegetables every day.

If health cultivation and maintenance is your default personal setting, you have leeway to enjoy yourself with friends and family, without overeating and hindering your health and fitness efforts. So have a homemade cookie, or share a small dessert with your dinner companion. Savor it, enjoy it, and then let it go.

4978,1,"2017-11-22 08:00:09","2017-11-22 08:00:09","You’ve probably heard that sleepiness after Thanksgiving dinner is the result of something called tryptophan in turkey. But what is tryptophan, and what effects, if any, does it really have on your body?

<strong>What is Tryptophan?</strong>

It's an <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.org/what-are-amino-acids.htm\">essential amino acid</a> found in many foods. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. The body can’t manufacture tryptophan, so we need to <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/l-tryptophan-uses-and-risks#1\">get it from our diets</a>. Turkey is among those foods high in tryptophan, although it's also found in other poultry, red meat, eggs, fish, nuts, seeds, and yogurt. Foods that are naturally high in protein also tend to contain the highest levels of tryptophan.

But there's a bit of a myth at work when it comes to the turkey-tryptophan connection. Chicken actually contains more tryptophan than turkey, and even though Americans consume chicken in far greater quantities over the course of the year, most people only associate it with Thanksgiving turkey.

Tryptophan is used by the body to create <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/the_13_essential_vitamins/\">niacin</a>, a B vitamin which plays a key role in the production of <a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/kc/serotonin-facts-232248\">serotonin</a>, a neurotransmitter associated with healthy sleep and feelings of wellbeing, and <a href=\"https://sleep.org/articles/melatonin/\">melatonin</a>, a hormone that regulates your sleep/wake cycles. In and of itself, however, tryptophan doesn’t immediately impact serotonin levels; it is just one of many amino acids competing for transport across the blood-brain barrier. Being a bulkier amino acid, it doesn’t so easily make it to the brain without help.

<strong>It’s All About Carbohydrates</strong>

The key lies in carbohydrates. When we eat them, our bodies release a surge of insulin, which clears the bloodstream of all amino acids — except tryptophan. When competing amino acids are removed from the bloodstream, tryptophan gets a straight shot to the brain, which boosts serotonin levels.

So why do people feel tired after their Thanksgiving meal? It probably has more to do with the heavy carbohydrate load than the turkey itself. Thanksgiving is also a time when many of us tend to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/overeating\">overeat</a>, and when we do, the digestive process is overtaxed, which also contributes to sleepiness. Throw a glass of wine or some alcohol into the mix, and we are definitely ready to nap once the family feast concludes.

<strong>Is Too Much Tryptophan Bad for You?</strong>

While we need it to live, consuming too much can have negative effects. Foods high in tryptophan are also high in protein, and many Americans already eat too much protein — especially from animal sources. Studies show that low-tryptophan diets lead to longer lifespans in rats, while too much causes insulin resistance and organ damage in pigs. Tryptophan <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-326-L-TRYPTOPHAN.aspx?activeIngredientId=326&amp;activeIngredientName=L-TRYPTOPHAN\">supplements and medications</a> are available as potential sleep aids (though their effectiveness is unclear) and antidepressants, but more research into their health benefits and risks is needed. It would be advisable to discuss the use of these supplements with your physician.

As technology facilitates the rise of virtual visits, allowing doctors to connect with patients remotely, the way they communicate in this new context is vitally important. As Dr. Elliott explains, \"We are looking for ways to leverage technology to improve access to top quality medical care and maximize the patient experience. We want to preserve the doctor-patient relationship while translating bedside manner to 'webside manner.'\"

Telemedicine is an incredible development in terms of access and convenience. As Dr. Elliott notes, it will also be a critical tool in offsetting an expected shortage of physicians in the coming years. The key is to ensure that allergists (and all physicians) give patients the same high level of care they would in a traditional setting. These new guidelines will help to update high standards of bedside manner for new modes of doctor-patient interaction.

5021,1,"2017-11-29 08:00:07","2017-11-29 08:00:07","Sleep hygiene is a <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/how_to_keep_good_sleep_hygiene/\">topic</a> that comes up often because it's <em>so</em> important. It essentially refers to a set of <a href=\"https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/sleep-hygiene\">strategies or habits</a> that promote good sleep. Getting a full night’s sleep, each and every night, is one of the most powerful ways to reduce stress and improve your health. Poor sleep can dramatically diminish your quality of life, and if you regularly skimp on rest, you are at risk for a host of physical and mental health conditions, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Depression</li>
 	<li>Mood disorders</li>
 	<li>Cognitive impairment</li>
 	<li>Decreased stress resilience</li>
 	<li>Diabetes</li>
 	<li>Stroke</li>
 	<li>Heart attack</li>
 	<li>Heart disease</li>
</ul>
<strong>Sleep and Mental Health</strong>

Sleep disturbances and mental health issues are <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sleep-deprivation/\">closely linked</a>. Dysfunctional sleep patterns are particularly common in patients with depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Clinicians have traditionally viewed sleep problems like insomnia and hypersomnia as symptoms of mental health disorders.; But research now suggests that disrupted sleep may directly contribute to — and certainly exacerbates — the development of mental illnesses. That's why good sleep hygiene is critical.

<strong>Simple Sleep Hygiene Tips</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Maintain a regular sleep/wake cycle</strong>: Aim to keep your schedule the same each night of the week. Sleep regularity is a huge part of sleep hygiene. Go to bed and wake up at the same time, every day, give or take 20 minutes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Avoid alcohol, caffeine</strong>, <strong>and nicotine</strong>: Stimulants should be avoided for four to six hours before bedtime. Alcohol may make you feel sleepy at first, but it acts as a stimulant after your body metabolizes it.</li>
 	<li><strong>Get regular exercise</strong>: Regular exercise reduces stress, depression, and anxiety, and can help you sleep more soundly. Physical activity helps us feel tired, making sleep easier. That said, exercising too close to bedtime is <em>not</em> recommended. Get your workout in at least three hours before trying to sleep. Better yet, exercise earlier in the day, whenever possible, especially if you're able to do so at the same time daily.</li>
 	<li><strong>Eat healthy </strong><a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/foods-that-affect-sleep\"><strong>foods that promote good sleep</strong></a>: Refined and processed carbs, poor quality fats, and spicy foods tend to contribute to indigestion and acid reflux, and often interfere with a good night’s rest. Eat a balanced, whole foods diet with an emphasis on high quality protein, good fats, complex carbohydrates, and antioxidants. Also, avoid heavy meals close to bedtime.</li>
 	<li><strong>Balance your liquid intake</strong>: Be sure to stay well hydrated during the day, and drink plenty of pure water. Limit fluids before bed, though, so you’re not losing sleep to middle-of-the-night bathroom trips.</li>
 	<li><strong>Establish a comforting pre-sleep routine</strong>: Make it a habit to wind down and relax before bed. Give yourself at least an hour before turning in, and engage in soothing activities: <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-meditation/\">meditate</a>, read a book, take a bath, or engage in <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/relaxation-therapy/\">relaxation exercises</a>. Avoid stressful news, electronic media, intense conversations, or work.</li>
 	<li><strong>Get exposure to natural light</strong>: Natural light helps set our <a href=\"https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/pages/Factsheet_CircadianRhythms.aspx\">circadian clocks</a> to a healthy sleep schedule. Let light in first thing in the morning, and spend some time outdoors each day.</li>
 	<li><strong>Create a simple, comfortable bedroom</strong>: Keep work materials, televisions, computers, and devices out of the bedroom as much as possible. Create an atmosphere that is peaceful and conducive to rest. A cool, quiet, dark environment is best for quality sleep. Invest in a quality mattress, as well as blankets and pillows. Install blackout curtains, or use a sleep mask, and utilize ear plugs or a white noise machine as needed.</li>
</ul>
Sleep hygiene is more important to overall health than many people realize. Make sure you're getting sufficient quality rest for your mind and body, every night.

5036,1,"2017-12-01 08:00:15","2017-12-01 08:00:15","It's important to recognize flu symptoms during this time of year. We're deep into flu season, in the midst of holidays that have us traveling, and spending more time than usual (perhaps) with the small children and elderly in our extended families.

Of course, it's recommended <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/common-vaccines/\">to be vaccinated</a> against influenza to improve your chances of avoiding flu symptoms altogether. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm\">Influenza</a> is a communicable virus which causes mild to severe illness, and it can affect both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Many people mistake the flu for a severe cold. But while they share some symptoms, the flu is usually more serious and enduring. Detecting flu symptoms early can help prevent the spread of the virus. Additionally, prompt treatment can keep the illness from becoming worse.

Early signs of the flu include:
<ul>
 	<li>Body aches and chills</li>
 	<li>Fever</li>
 	<li>Fatigue</li>
 	<li>Sore throat</li>
 	<li>Vomiting or gastrointestinal distress (more common in children)</li>
 	<li>Runny or stuffy nose</li>
 	<li>Cough</li>
 	<li>Headache</li>
</ul>
<strong>Flu Symptoms in Children</strong>

Children may present with the above symptoms, but they sometimes have additional complications that may require medical treatment. These include:
<ul>
 	<li>Dehydration</li>
 	<li>Crying without producing tears</li>
 	<li>Loss of appetite</li>
 	<li>Fever accompanied by rash</li>
 	<li>Difficulty urinating</li>
</ul>
In children, a cold and flu can look similar. But if a fever is present, and symptoms are severe, it is probably the flu. If you have any concerns about your child’s symptoms, or if they worsen, contact your pediatrician right away.

<strong>Emergency Flu Symptoms</strong>

Flu symptoms sometimes worsen before they improve, and the severity of the illness depends on the overall state of your health. People respond differently to a virus, with some fighting it off more efficiently. If the following symptoms appear, seek medical treatment:
<ul>
 	<li>Severe dehydration</li>
 	<li>Difficulties breathing</li>
 	<li>Worsening or recurring fever</li>
 	<li>Worsening cough</li>
 	<li>Dizziness</li>
 	<li>Disorientation</li>
 	<li>Chest pain</li>
</ul>
<strong>Flu Complications</strong>

Recovery from the flu usually occurs in one to two weeks — but complications can happen. Certain populations <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/high_risk.htm\">tend to be more vulnerable</a> to these complications, including children, those over age 65, pregnant women, and individuals with certain chronic medical conditions or lowered immunity. Sinus infections, pneumonia, and bronchitis are examples of flu-related complications. The flu can also exacerbate existing health problems, such as asthma, heart conditions, and chronic lung disease. For those at high risk of complications, medical treatment and hospitalization may be necessary.

<strong>Recovery</strong>

If you have been diagnosed with the flu, it is important to allow yourself an adequate recovery period. You should not return to work or school until you have been fever-free for at least 24 hours, without medication. If your fever has broken but other symptoms persist, it is best to stay home until these symptoms also improve. Once you can resume normal activities without exhaustion, you can return to work and your typical routine. After recovery, a lingering cough or some fatigue may persist for a few weeks; see your doctor if you begin to relapse, or if symptoms worsen again after your initial recovery.

<strong>Prevention</strong><strong> </strong>

Remember that the flu vaccine, while not guaranteed to prevent the illness, is by far the best preventive course of action. The flu spreads through saliva droplets <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm\">when an infected person coughs or sneezes</a>. These droplets can reach people and surfaces up to 6 feet away. It is important to take steps to protect yourself and those you love from infection during virus season. In terms of other basic recommendations to avoid contracting — or further spreading — the flu, be sure to follow this protocol:
<ul>
 	<li>Staying home if you are sick, especially if fever is present</li>
 	<li>Covering your cough the right way (cough into the crook of your elbow, and not your hands)</li>
 	<li>Washing your hands frequently</li>
 	<li>Avoiding close contact with sick people</li>
 	<li>Touching your mouth and nose as little as possible</li>
</ul>

5043,1,"2017-12-04 08:00:52","2017-12-04 08:00:52","<strong>Why the Flu Shot Matters</strong>

The flu shot is the most effective preventive measure when it comes to avoiding influenza, which has unpleasant <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/flu-symptoms\">symptoms</a> and can present serious <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/complications.htm\">complications</a>. The virus, which impacts the respiratory tract, can infect a person’s lungs, nose, and throat. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, mostly in children. Among adults, typical symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, runny nose, and body aches.

Flu season begins around mid-October, peaks during the winter months, and ends around May. The flu is highly contagious, and it can be severe. Even healthy people sometimes develop complications, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/high_risk.htm\">Certain populations are especially vulnerable</a>, and medical care and hospitalization are necessary in some cases.

That's why the flu shot is so critical for both individual and communal prevention. The CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/whoshouldvax.htm\">recommends an annual vaccination</a> for everyone six months of age or older. There are certain exceptions for individuals with allergies to the vaccine or its components. If you have ever had Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), your doctor may advise against the flu shot. If your immunity is compromised or you are not feeling well, speak to your doctor before receiving the flu vaccine. Also note that different flu shots have specific age indications; speak with your doctor about which shot is your best choice.

<strong>When to Get the Flu Shot</strong>

It's best to have the flu shot administered when flu season begins in October. Obviously, the sooner, the better. But people who have not been vaccinated often forget about it once the initial media and workplace attention to flu shots dies down. It's <strong>not</strong> too late to receive a flu shot in November, December, and beyond. It's only \"too late\" once you contract the flu. Just know that after vaccination, it takes about two weeks for protective antibodies to develop in the body.

<strong>Types of Flu Vaccination and Possible Side Effects</strong>

The flu vaccine will <strong>not</strong> give you the flu, contrary to a popular myth. But side effects can occur.

<strong>Flu shot:</strong> The viruses in the flu shot are inactivated (killed), so you cannot get the flu from the flu shot. Potential side effects include:
<ul>
 	<li>Redness, soreness, and/or swelling at the site of the shot</li>
 	<li>Body aches</li>
 	<li>Low-grade fever</li>
</ul>
<strong>Nasal spray:</strong> The viruses in the nasal spray are <em>not</em> inactivated, but they are sufficiently weakened to ensure you can’t develop the flu from it. Side effects in children may include:
<ul>
 	<li>Fever</li>
 	<li>Muscle and body aches</li>
 	<li>Runny nose</li>
 	<li>Coughing</li>
 	<li>Wheezing</li>
 	<li>Vomiting</li>
 	<li>Headache</li>
</ul>
Side effects in adults can include:

The flu vaccine is primarily recommended as an injection, as it is more effective. The shot is usually given through a muscle in the arm. For those between 18 and 64 years of age, an intradermal (in-the-skin) vaccine is an option, or a jet injector device is also available, in which the vaccine is delivered via a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid instead of a needle.

If side effects occur, it is usually soon after the vaccination. Symptoms are mild and brief. Occasionally, individuals do have more severe reactions, particularly if they are allergic. If you are concerned about your reactions, contact your doctor immediately.

Whether you're looking for gifts to give your family, friends, coworkers, or anyone on your \"Secret Santa\" list, there are a number of great, affordable ideas that promote wellness. We're all about building healthy habits here, so we've mostly selected holiday gifts that can become part of your daily routine all year long.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Sunlight desk lamp - </strong>As the days get shorter, seasonal affective disorder and other types of <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/types-of-depression/\">depression</a> may become pronounced. By mimicking natural sunlight, these <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=sunlight+desk+lamps&amp;tag=geminimobiles-20&amp;index=aps&amp;hvadid=27668047&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvbmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;ref=pd_sl_2yvvx32\">lamps</a> can help banish the blues all winter. They're stylish, affordable, and can even boost production of serotonin and vitamin D during the months when you're missing healthy sun exposure.</li>
 	<li><strong>Portable blender</strong> <strong>-</strong> Blenders are critical for lots of <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/butternut-squash-soup/\">healthy recipes</a>, but they're perhaps most useful when it comes to making quick-and-easy, nutritious smoothies with a variety of greens, fruits, and veggies. Single serving <a href=\"http://www.jcpenney.com/g/magic-bullet-small-kitchen-appliances/N-1b2ke21D1nohrcZ1q0?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=paid%20search&amp;cid=paid%20search%7cbin\">portable blenders</a> with their own to-go cups make blending up your favorite concoctions before work or the gym a breeze.</li>
 	<li><strong>Stainless steel, filtered water bottles -</strong> Staying hydrated (with pure water) is vitally important, whether you're working out or just going through your day. Having a stainless steel bottle by your side winds up helping in a variety of ways. It reminds you to keep drinking (roughly 64 ounces per day for the average adult), avoids the waste of disposable plastic bottles, restricts exposure to BPA. Plus, you can <a href=\"https://www.swellbottle.com\">personalize your gift</a>!</li>
 	<li><strong>CSA membership - </strong>Community supported agriculture (delivered to your door) is a fantastic way to help local farms and eat a variety of fresh produce. Subscriptions vary but can be a lot more affordable than you may think!</li>
 	<li><strong>Healthy cookbooks - </strong>While cookbooks may seem like a boring and obvious choice, there's never been a more exciting variety of options, no matter your recipient's dietary restrictions, culinary skill level, or specific food interests. Cookbooks are great for inspiration, and for guiding new home cooks who lack skills or confidence in the kitchen. For the experienced healthy foodie, a new cookbook can offer fresh ideas - keeping nutritious meals appealing and exciting.</li>
 	<li><strong>Foam roller - </strong>Whether you do daily stretching, floor exercises, or physical therapy, these comfortable and easy-to-clean <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Density-Round-Foam-Roller/dp/B00XM2MRGI/ref=sr_1_5?s=exercise-and-fitness&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1512744286&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=foam+roller\">rollers</a> are excellent and versatile accessories for wellness.</li>
 	<li><strong>Yoga mat - </strong>Along the same lines, for anyone in your life who's either a hardcore practitioner or just <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/what_are_the_types_of_yoga/\">getting into it</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/BalanceFrom-Purpose-Anti-Tear-Exercise-Carrying/dp/B00FO9ZRYQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1512749240&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=yoga+mat\">yoga mats</a> are a wonderful gift. They come in all types of styles, are easy to carry, and are great for the yogi-on-the-go.</li>
 	<li><strong>Herb mill - </strong>Great for easily adding fresh flavors to foods when cutting back on added salt and cooking fats, this handy <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Herb-Mill/s?ie=UTF8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3AHerb%20Mill\">kitchen gadget</a> minces fresh herbs with the flick of a wrist.</li>
 	<li><strong>Healthy gift baskets - </strong>Instead of giving sugar-rich candies or cakes as gifts, try gift baskets filled with fresh and dried fruits, herbal teas, organic coffees, air-popped popcorn, whole grain crackers, and low-sugar dark chocolate.</li>
 	<li><strong>Gym, health club, or yoga class memberships - </strong>You can also give gift certificates or memberships for a local pilates studio, personal trainer sessions, or massages.</li>
 	<li><strong>Adult lunch boxes -</strong> Meal prep isn't just a cost-saver — it also helps to keep people on track nutritionally, all week long. And with a cool-looking lunch box, who wouldn't want to bring in their own meals from home? (Plus, brown bagging is so wasteful!) There are plenty of sleek designs in bright colors that keep food healthy and fun, even for the grownups in your life.</li>
 	<li><strong>Sleeping mask</strong> <strong>-</strong> We're passionate advocates for proper <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sleep-hygiene/\">sleep hygiene</a>, and a major part of sleeping well is creating a dark environment. If someone in your life has trouble getting the bedroom sufficiently dark, a quality mask can be a game-changer.</li>
 	<li><strong>Food steamer</strong> <strong>-</strong> Steaming vegetables is a great way to cook them without sacrificing any of their nutrients. You can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-Digital-Food-Steamer/dp/B00MA34AB0/ref=sr_1_4?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1512672748&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=digital+food+steamer\">get a handy</a> digital food steamer for anyone in need of a simpler, more healthy cooking regimen.</li>
 	<li><strong>Aromatherapy -</strong> For a soothing, stress-reducing gift sure to delight the recipient, get a simple scent diffuser and a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Radha-Beauty-Aromatherapy-Essential-Therapeutic/dp/B0163GBZK8/ref=sr_1_4_s_it?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1512675576&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=aromatherapy+essential+oils\">set of essential oils</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Wearables</strong> <strong>-</strong> Fitness tracking devices (especially Fitbits or Apple Watches) are going to be pricier than most of the holiday gifts on this list... but they're well worth the investment if you know someone who needs daily (or even hourly) encouragement and monitoring to meet health goals.</li>
</ol>
Holiday gifts that promote healthy lifestyles are available for nearly any budget. Fun, frivolous things can be great holiday gifts, too! But these wellness-oriented suggestions (and many others) are designed to support the long-term health of the people you care about most. Here's to ending the year with what everyone needs for an even healthier 2018!

5072,1,"2017-12-08 09:00:04","2017-12-08 09:00:04","Holiday stress is real. After all, the season can be a complicated time. While we may look forward to winter vacations, beloved family traditions, fun parties, and extended visits with close friends, the holidays can also be a period of increased anxiety and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/types-of-depression/\">depression</a>. You may face family tensions. You may find your budget overextended or your schedule overloaded. Any number of factors could make the time feel more frenzied than festive.

Generally speaking, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-meditation/\">meditation</a>, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/relaxation-therapy/\">relaxation therapy</a>, and proper <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sleep-hygiene/\">sleep hygiene</a> can all be excellent stress reducers. But there are also ways to minimize holiday stress, specifically. Here are some of them.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Relax your expectations</strong>. The holidays don’t have to be perfect. You don't have to be perfect during them. Focus on the quality of the time you spend with friends and family. Don’t overemphasize materials, whether presents or decorations. Exchanging gifts should be pleasurable; try to keep things simple, <a href=\"https://liveboldandbloom.com/12/lifestyle/40-mindful-and-meaningful-holiday-gifts\">meaningful</a>, and affordable. Prioritize what matters most!</li>
 	<li><strong>Avoid overspending</strong>. Set a budget for your holiday expenses and gift giving... and then stick to it! A lot of holiday stress has to do with financial pressure, and while you may want to be generous, you can still control your spending. Take a look at your bills, and set a realistic amount you can afford. Your holiday expenditures should not interfere with your ability to pay for essentials, and they should not result in overwhelming credit card debt that will haunt you as soon as the new year begins.</li>
 	<li><strong>Don’t overextend</strong>. Keep your commitments realistic. What can you do without sacrificing adequate rest, exercise, and self-care? Fatigue from undersleeping and overexertion can contribute to depression and anxiety. Don’t take on such a burden that you are unable to enjoy the most important part of the season: time with loved ones and family.</li>
 	<li><strong>Take in the good</strong>. Psychologist and author Rick Hanson calls noticing and absorbing good experiences “<a href=\"http://www.rickhanson.net/take-in-the-good/\">taking in the good,</a>\" and it's an approach we often don't take when things get hectic. When you have a positive thought, experience, or emotion, take the time to savor it. Learn to dwell on the positive. Negative emotions and experiences are unavoidable, but by learning to emphasize the good in your life, you train your brain to reinforce more positive thinking patterns. In doing so, you boost your stress resilience.</li>
 	<li><strong>Eat healthy foods and stay active</strong>. It’s normal to want to rest and indulge in treats during the holidays. Don’t overdo it, though! Take a brisk walk either before or after a big meal, and make time for exercise. Stay hydrated with pure water, and emphasize fresh fruits and vegetables. Too many sweets and rich foods can negatively impact the immune system, so stay focused on eating well as much as possible and indulging with some moderation. Better yet, learn to upgrade your traditional favorites with healthier versions: check out some truly amazing whole foods <a href=\"http://www.nourishingmeals.com/p/recipe-index.html\">recipes here</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Take breaks</strong>. Family relationships can be complicated. If tensions arise, or if a particular family member makes things challenging, take some time for yourself. Go get some exercise, nap, or meditate. We can’t control the behaviors of others, but we can control how we <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/stress-management/\">respond to stress</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Acknowledge your feelings</strong>. If you have experienced past trauma, recently lost someone you love, or are feeling isolated during the holidays, it is normal to experience sadness or grief -- especially during the holiday season. You are not alone if you aren’t feeling so great during the festive season. It’s OK to cry, grieve, or opt out altogether. Take care of yourself. If you need support, reach out. Call a trusted friend, counselor, or even a <a href=\"http://crisiscallcenter.org/crisisservices-html/\">crisis hotline</a> if depression sets in. If you are feeling alone, try <a href=\"https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/index.jsp?l=united+states&amp;k=holiday\">volunteering</a> your time to connect with others in a positive way. You can also join a support group or take a new class to meet others with common interests and life experiences.</li>
</ol>
Unchecked holiday stress could lead to physical ailments that put a real damper on the season. The most important thing is to be mindful of how you feel so you can regulate your stress response as quickly and fully as possible. Learn to say no to anything that puts too much pressure on you. Eat well, get adequate sleep, and keep exercising. Simplify where you need to, deemphasize consumerism, and instead focus on what's most meaningful: family connectedness, generosity, self-care, and creating positive memories to carry with you into the new year. It may sound hokey, but it's an excellent way of avoiding holiday stress and preserving emotional wellness!

But that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice <em>all</em> of the healthy habits you're trying to keep! Holiday cocktails can be healthy (or, at least, <em>healthier</em>) than you might expect, as long as you give some thought to the ingredients ahead of time.

We've come up with a few modified recipes for holiday cocktails (including one that's easily turned into an alcohol-free \"mocktail\"), each of which offers some nice health benefits along with the usual seasonal cheer.

<em>The recipes below serve eight delicious, healthy holiday cocktails apiece</em> <em>unless otherwise indicated</em>.

<em>And, of course, please drink responsibly!</em>
<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Pomegranate Sparkler</strong></h2>
<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5172\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-08-at-4.03.46-PM-1024x947.png\" alt=\"Pomegranate Sparkler\" width=\"500\" height=\"462\" />

Want to add some lush color to your cocktail offerings? How about some critical nutrients and powerful preventive health benefits? <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318385.php\">Pomegranate juice</a> has anti-inflammatory properties, comes packed with antioxidants, and contains polyphenols shown to counteract <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/prostate-cancer/\">prostate</a> and breast cancers. The fruit is also good for your heart, with research showing that it can help lower blood pressure and reduce plaque in the carotid artery. (How's that for a holiday gift?) Pomegranate juice is also a good source of vitamins C and E, as well as potassium. That all makes these sparkling holiday cocktails an exciting option for you and your loved ones.

<strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong>:
eight ounces of pomegranate juice (be sure to get 100% juice with no added sugar)
four ounces of fruit liqueur (such as Curacao or Grand Marnier)
four teaspoons of lime juice (or lime wedges)
four teaspoons of pomegranate seeds
several sprigs of mint (if so desired)
sparkling wine (chilled)

<strong><em>Preparation</em></strong>:
Sprinkle pomegranate seeds into Champagne flutes, followed by the pomegranate juice and your chosen liqueur. Add lime and then pour the chilled sparkling wine. Top off with mint and enjoy!
<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Dairy-Free Eggnog</strong></h2>
<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5167\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Eggnog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Dairy-Free Eggnog\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />

&nbsp;

Eggnog is among the most polarizing holiday drinks, so even if it's not your favorite, there's a good chance someone at your party may ask, \"Hey, where's the nog?\" One major problem with traditional eggnog in modern times? Lots of people are <a href=\"https://www.vegan.com/dairy-free/\">going off dairy</a>. Fortunately, we have a solution. This dairy-free eggnog recipe is just as delicious as the standard version, but substitutes almond milk and coconut milk for the cow milk your guests may be trying to avoid. And it couldn't be any simpler to make!

<strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong>:
four cups of coconut milk
four cups of almond milk
eight large egg yolks
one cup of pure maple syrup
two teaspoons of ground cinnamon
two teaspoons of nutmeg
two teaspoons of pure vanilla extract

<strong><em>Preparation</em></strong>:
Combine all ingredients (except nutmeg) in a blender. Blend for approximately two minutes. Egg yolks should be fully processed. Chill in refrigerator until ready to serve, then pour and top with nutmeg.
<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Ginger Cider Hot Toddy</strong></h2>
<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5169\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Hot-Toddy-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Hot Toddy\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />

It's hard to find anything more comforting on a chilly winter's night than this classic drink, whether you include alcohol or not! In fact, one of the best things about a hot toddy is that it can be tailored for almost any taste — since the tea and cider varieties are up to you — and still be great. This version includes <a href=\"https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/ginger.html\">ginger</a>, which aids digestion, boosts immune function, and has been shown to have a positive impact on everything from cholesterol to respiration to reducing nausea. If you make yours with green tea, you'll also get the benefit of polyphenols.

<em>Makes one mug</em>.

<strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong>:

two cups of warm apple cider
one tea bag
one tablespoon of honey
1/8 teaspoon of ginger
one lemon
one cinnamon stick
one shot of your preferred whiskey (optional)

<em><strong>Preparation</strong></em>:

Heat mug of cider and steep tea bag for five minutes. Mix in ginger and honey. Add booze. Stir with cinnamon stick. Top with slice of lemon. Enjoy!
<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>White Sangria</strong></h2>
<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5170\" src=\"https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/White-Sangria-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"White Sangria\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />

This festive, fruit-filled crowdpleaser features the many health benefits of <a href=\"http://www.eatingwell.com/article/17769/5-health-benefits-of-an-apple/\">apples</a> (they help in the fight against cardiovascular disease, contain antioxidants and soluble fiber), citrus (vitamin C, flavonoids, potassium), and the often overlooked nutritional advantages of <a href=\"https://www.livestrong.com/article/377858-the-health-benefits-of-white-wine/\">white wine</a>.

<strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong>:

two bottles of white wine
two apples
two cups of preferred citrus fruit
one cup of grapes
one cup of frozen tropical fruit (like mango)

<em><strong>Preparation</strong></em>:

This one is especially easy. Just cut up the fruit, add to a pitcher of white wine, refrigerate overnight, and serve!

5178,1,"2018-01-06 22:52:47","2018-01-06 22:52:47","<a href=\"https://eheintl.com/hydration\">Hydration</a> is essential to good health. It's also something a lot of people overlook. If you're not paying attention and keeping good hydration habits, you may not be drinking sufficient water. If so, dehydration symptoms could sneak up on you.

An individual's personal water requirements vary due to a range of factors, but adults are typically advised to aim for about two liters (or 64 ounces) of daily consumption. Once your body signals thirst, you are already mildly dehydrated. Other low-level dehydration symptoms <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/symptoms-causes/syc-20354086\">can include</a> fatigue, difficulty concentrating, crankiness, and headaches. The body and brain are both susceptible to dehydration symptoms.

<strong>Dehydration Symptoms of the Brain </strong>

Our brains depend on adequate hydration to function well. Even minimal dehydration can create problems as brain tissue loses fluid, reducing brain volume and affecting cell activity. This negatively impacts your mood, memory, and attention span. Dehydration can also affect both short-term and long-term memory recall. Simple math becomes more difficult, and you may experience headaches, mood disruption, and grogginess. The brain is sensitive to even small changes in the body’s water content.

<strong>Dehydration Symptoms of the Body</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Dehydration means extra work for your heart</strong>. Blood volume decreases during dehydration, but the heart must maintain adequate blood flow to your organs and muscles. To maintain stable blood pressure with less blood, your heart exerts more and vessels constrict. This could lead you to experience aches and pains.</li>
 	<li><strong>Your skin dries out. </strong>Dehydrated skin becomes parched and sometimes looks flushed. It may “tent up” when pinched, indicating a loss in hydration and elasticity.</li>
 	<li><strong>You may get migraines and headaches. </strong>Just as dehydration causes body aches, so too does it contribute to headaches and even migraines. Sometimes the simplest remedy is a full glass of water.</li>
 	<li><strong>Food cravings, especially cravings for sweets, may kick in. </strong>When dehydrated, you may have hunger cravings when the body actually needs is water. All of your organs rely on hydration for optimal function. They may struggle to release adequate energy stores such as glucose (glycogen) when you are dehydrated. This can result in intense cravings for food, and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sugar/\">sweets</a> in particular, which will not satisfy your immediate water needs.</li>
 	<li><strong>You may get a fever and chills. </strong>If your level of dehydration becomes severe, fever and chills may set in (fever can also exacerbate existing dehydration). The higher your fever, the higher the risk for more severe systemic dehydration. In infants and children, this can be especially dangerous, especially if vomiting or <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/diarrhea-the-1-travelers-health-issue/\">diarrhea</a> are occurring. Be sure to seek medical attention if you are dehydrated and experiencing a fever over 103 degrees.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Tips on Staying Hydrated</strong>

Hydration starts with drinking pure water throughout the day. Hydrating foods help, but you still need to drink enough water. Check out this <a href=\"http://www.h4hinitiative.com/tools/hydration-calculator\">daily water intake calculator</a> here to see more personalized guidelines.

Here are some general recommendations:
<ul>
 	<li>Drink a large glass of water first thing in the morning.</li>
 	<li>Keep a water bottle with you throughout the day.</li>
 	<li>Add some lemon, lime, or a little juice to your water if you don’t love the taste.</li>
 	<li>Drink water before, during, and after exercise.</li>
 	<li>Eat plentiful amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables.</li>
 	<li>Drink herbal teas.</li>
</ul>
Remember to listen to your body to detect dehydration symptoms. If you are feeling thirsty, or if you have been exercising and sweating profusely, be sure to drink more water. Make it a habit to stay well-hydrated throughout the day, and maintain a consistent intake of hydrating foods such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and salads.

5189,1,"2017-12-15 08:00:09","2017-12-15 08:00:09","Stress relief is critical. In our frenetic modern world, stress is a near constant fact of life for many. Between the demands of work life, personal life, and distressing world events, the need for stress relief products and methods is at an all-time high. Learning to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/stress-management/\">manage stress</a> effectively is vital to positive long-term health outcomes, both mental and physical. That's why it's so important to find a few tools to weave into your daily routine, so you can mitigate the impact of stress on your body and mind.

<strong>Stress Relief Toys for Adults</strong>

Stress relief toys and gadgets come in a variety of styles, and are designed to calm your mind and nervous system by distracting you from stressful situations.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Fidget Toys </strong>- <a href=\"https://www.focusfied.com/fidget-toys-help-adhd-add/\">Fidgets</a> are tactile self-regulation toys like <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Slime-Stress-Ball/\">slime balls</a>, spinner toys, and squishy cubes and balls. These increase sensory awareness of your fingers, help reduce stress, and promote better concentration.</li>
 	<li><strong>Stress Balls </strong>- These are small balls made of gel or soft clay that fit comfortably in the palm of your hand. Stress balls encourage good blood circulation, and as you repetitively squeeze them, stress, tension, and other negative emotions decrease or subside. Manipulating stress balls stimulates the brain to release feel-good endorphins, which are natural sedatives and pain relievers. Stress balls also stimulate nerves in your hand which connect to the brain’s limbic region (the area of the brain associated with emotions), promoting feelings of calm and relaxation.</li>
 	<li><strong>Dammit Dolls </strong>- This doll for grownups is designed to vent your frustrations and will withstand endless banging on your desk. <a href=\"https://dammitdolls.com/Home\">Dammit dolls</a> are great for a laugh, and lightening things up at work.</li>
 	<li><strong>Magnetic Sculpture Desk Toys </strong>- These tactile sculptures sit on your desk, allowing you to fidget in order to relieve stress and think more creatively.</li>
 	<li><strong>Desktop Zen Garden</strong> - These small replicas of traditional Japanese meditative gardens come with small rakes and brooms to drag through the sand. Making patterns calms your mind, and helps reduce stress and anxiety.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Additional Stress Relief Tools</strong>

In addition to stress relieving toys, there are many simple and easy ways to self-regulate throughout the day.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Learn to meditate</strong> - Meditation is a powerful way to relieve the physical and mental strain of cumulative and chronic stress. <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-meditation/\">Meditation</a> offers many benefits, and even five minutes a day can reduce anxiety and stress.</li>
 	<li><strong>Drink </strong><a href=\"http://truestressmanagement.com/best-tea-for-stress/\"><strong>stress relieving teas</strong></a> - Peppermint, camomile, passion flower, lemon balm, rose, and green tea (among others) all contain stress relief compounds that will help soothe and calm your system.</li>
 	<li><strong>Check out some apps </strong>- Apps are a great tool for accessing meditations and stress-reducing exercises. <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/\">Calm</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-mindfulness-app/id417071430?mt=8\">Mindfulness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.aurahealth.io/\">Aura</a> are excellent choices.</li>
 	<li><strong>Practice good sleep hygiene </strong>- <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sleep-hygiene/\">Sleep hygiene</a> is a set of habits and practices conducive to a good night’s sleep. Quality sleep on a regular basis is a cornerstone of maintaining sound mental and physical health. Stress resilience decreases dramatically when sleep is compromised. Sleep hygiene helps us sync up with our natural circadian rhythms, so we rest deeply at night, and have ample energy during the day.</li>
 	<li><strong>Exercise regularly</strong> - Regular, vigorous <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-exercise/\">exercise</a> is one of the best ways to relieve stress, shore up our overall health, and sleep more deeply at night. Pick a routine, workout plan, or activity you enjoy doing, and commit to it.</li>
</ul>
Remember that while stress is normal, and can even be useful when moderate, <em>chronic</em> stress wears us down. Stress relief is part of basic wellness. We must regulate our stress in order to keep our mental and physical health in balance. The more you commit to your health by eating well, cultivating healthy sleep, and choosing activities and tools that help you manage your stress response, the stronger your daily health will be.

5200,1,"2017-12-19 08:00:34","2017-12-19 08:00:34","Giving up <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sugar/\">sugar</a> can leave us feeling deprived and as though we'll never eat dessert again. But this recipe for sugar-free peanut butter cookies is proof that cutting out most sugar doesn't mean needing to give up treats altogether! These cookies taste great, and you'll feel like you're indulging... but <em>without</em> wrecking havoc on your system.

Processed sugar adds unnecessary calories to your diet <a href=\"https://www.organics.org/natural-vs-processed-sugars/\">without giving you the nutrients you need</a>. The body is not particularly interested in calories themselves. Its primary focus is getting specific nutrients. Everything from fluid balance, nerve function, metabolism, energy production, bone structure, and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/digestive_health/\">proper digestion</a> all require specific macronutrients and micronutrients. When we fill our diet with nutritionally empty calories — such as sugar, processed wheat, and poor quality dairy — our body continues to give us hunger signals, since it hasn't received what it needs. This can lead to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/overeating/\">overeating</a> and weight gain over time.

Fructose, when consumed through fruit, where the micronutrients and fiber slow the release of sugar into the bloodstream, isn't something to fear. However, when consumed in excess in the form of processed and packaged sugars, soda, and desserts, it will be converted into glycogen and stored by the liver. For individuals who chronically overeat these foods, the liver becomes too full of glycogen and begin to turn fructose into fat. This can lead to a condition called fatty liver and, if left untreated, eventually liver disease.

Organic stevia has been used for centuries. It is a plant with naturally sweet leaves. While the stevia plant can be grown and used in its natural form, more conveniently it has also been turned into a powder which can be found in most grocery stores. Be sure to choose 100% organic stevia to avoid other additives and chemicals some brands use in their formulas. Since it does not affect the blood sugar, stevia can be a great option for preventing metabolic syndrome, keeping mood and energy stable, and creating steady hunger levels. Stevia also contains antioxidant properties, which helps fight inflammation in the body (whereas regular sugar actually <em>causes</em> inflammation in the body).

<b>Ingredients for Sugar-Free Peanut Butter Cookies:</b>
1.5 cups peanut butter
3 tablespoons cacao
2 eggs
1/4 cup chopped peanuts
1 teaspoon stevia powder*
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

*If you prefer the taste of sugar over stevia, you can replace with 1/2 cup of coconut palm sugar.

5223,1,"2017-12-15 19:16:54","2017-12-15 19:16:54","A power nap is like a reboot for your body and brain. The key is to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/how_much_sleep_is_enough/\">sleep at the right times, for the right length of time</a>, in order to optimize energy and alertness. Growing research shows that napping is a smart thing to do. In our increasingly sleep-deprived culture, napping is actually a good way to maximize rest time each day.

If you practice good <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sleep-hygiene/\">sleep hygiene</a>, or if you struggle with insomnia, a well-orchestrated daytime power nap can help regulate your sleep rhythms, without compromising your quality of nighttime sleep. 85 percent of mammals are polyphasic, meaning their sleep and wakeful times cycle throughout both day and night. Most humans tend to sleep in monophasic cycles, due to centuries of social norms regarding how we organize our days. But scientists aren’t clear if such a schedule is really the best thing for our health.

Many cultures still value afternoon naps, and young children and the elderly are likelier to have something closer to polyphasic rest. Regardless of whether our reliance on nighttime sleep is wise, we are a sleep-deprived world, overall. In this context, a power nap can provide some significant health benefits.

<strong>How Long Should I Power Nap?</strong><strong> </strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>90 Minutes: </strong>This provides a full cycle of sleep, allowing you to reach deep sleep and REM (rapid eye movement) states. A full sleep cycle improves procedural and emotional memory, as well as creativity and overall performance. Sleeping for this length of time also helps prevent sleep inertia, making it easier to wake up.</li>
 	<li><strong>60 Minutes: </strong>This nap length includes deep, slow wave sleep, but may not allow you to finish a full cycle, meaning that some grogginess can occur upon waking. But napping for an hour is still beneficial for restoring your muscles and refreshing your mind.</li>
 	<li><strong>30 Minutes: </strong>Studies show that a half-hour nap is most likely to cause grogginess, or sleep inertia, which can last up to 30 minutes after you wake. This nap’s restorative benefits can be felt after this initial transition passes.</li>
 	<li><strong>10 to 20 Minutes: </strong>This is the quintessential power nap, and is excellent for a boost in alertness and energy. This brief window limits you to lighter sleep states, thereby bypassing sleep inertia, and making it easier to wake up energized and ready to go.</li>
</ul>
Knowing when to nap, and for how long, is key to maximizing energy while still being conducive to great nighttime sleep. If you find yourself dreaming during power naps, it can mean you are sleep-deprived and need to increase your sleeping hours at night. If you sit slightly upright during a nap, you can usually avoid too-deep sleep. Another suggestion is to rest on top of your covers with a light blanket if needed; sleeping under the covers only at nighttime is good sleep hygiene. Remember that your sleep environment counts. Try to get rest in a quiet, peaceful place, with little light filtering in, and keep the room at a comfortable temperature.

<strong>The Power Nap As Work Strategy</strong><strong> </strong>

<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432808002416\">A 2008 study showed that power naps surpass caffeine</a> when it comes to recharging motor skills, memory, and perceptual learning. Many modern companies are catching on to the impact of strategic rest by creating sleep and rest spaces in the workplace. Google, the Huffington Post, and other employers have specially designed sleep pods for their workers to catch some zzzs during the day. It makes for healthier employees, period. Naps lessen the stress response, and can help regulate blood pressure and cardiovascular recovery after periods of psychological stress.

Remember that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/5874738/calculate-the-best-time-to-nap-with-this-interactive-nap-wheel\">timing your naps well</a> is important to promoting great rest at night, so don’t nap for at least three to four hours before your usual bedtime. Syncing up your waking, nap, and bedtime schedules so that you are optimizing energy and alertness, while also ensuring restorative sleep at night, is essential.

5226,1,"2017-12-15 19:19:10","2017-12-15 19:19:10","Energy foods are just what they sound like. These are the foods that keep you alert and active without needing to resort to <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678\">caffeine</a> or less nutritionally sound artificial boosters. The best energy foods don't just fight morning fatigue; they also keep us moving all day. In addition to practicing good <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sleep-hygiene/\">sleep hygiene</a>, one of the best and simplest ways to raise your energy levels is to mix healthy energy foods into your daily diet. Whether you suffer from a <a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/healthy-diet.aspx\">chronic fatigue</a> condition, or simply want to beat that afternoon slump, here are some great, energizing options to add to your weekly meal and snack rotation.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Peppermint</strong> increases mental alertness and lessens fatigue. Waking up to a morning cup of peppermint tea is a fantastic alternative to coffee, and is great for an afternoon energy boost. Peppermint is also a powerful digestive aid, and may even help headaches.</li>
 	<li><strong>Water</strong> may seem like an obvious choice, but even mild dehydration can cause major energy slumps. Start your day with a large glass of water, and make sure to keep sipping throughout the day. Aim for approximately 64 ounces of pure, filtered water each and every day. And remember — the more physically active you are, the more water you'll need to keep your body adequately hydrated.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://eheintl.com/preferred_source_of_vitamins/\"><strong>Fresh fruit </strong></a>is loaded with fiber, antioxidants, and vitamin C, and is one of your most reliably satisfying energy foods. Fresh bananas, oranges, apples, and berries are easy to tote around, pack as a snack or lunch, and will give you a dose of vitamins, minerals, and good carbs for a quick energy boost.</li>
 	<li><strong>Almonds and walnuts </strong>are packed with fiber, beneficial fats, and vitamin E and omega-3s which make for a nutrient-dense energy boost that will curb hunger cravings. Nuts are easy to overeat, though, so keep your serving to around one ounce.</li>
 	<li><strong>Asparagus </strong>is a high energy food rich in B vitamins. Asparagus is also a good choice since it provides a low glycemic, gradual energy release for sustained energy throughout the day.</li>
 	<li><strong>Leafy greens </strong>like spinach, kale, and chard are very rich in energy-promoting nutrients, as well as brain-boosting compounds like folate, calcium, vitamins K and C, and beta-carotene.</li>
 	<li><strong>Dark chocolate </strong>contains the natural stimulant theobromine, which provides solid energy. Highly concentrated dark chocolate is also excellent for <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/brain-food/\">brain health</a>; it's high in nutrients and antioxidants that reduce stress, while amplifying energy and mental focus.</li>
</ol>
Beyond eating the right energy foods, it's important to pay attention to adequate hydration, sleep hygiene practices, and daily movement and exercise. Exercise not only tones and strengthens the body, but it releases energy-boosting endorphins, and promotes better quality sleep. If you eat right, move your body, and stay hydrated each day, you will maximize your energy levels and feel better than ever!

5229,1,"2017-12-25 09:00:51","2017-12-25 09:00:51","Did you get a wearable fitness tracker over the holidays? Or are you planning to dust off the one you bought last year as part of a New Year's resolution? Whatever your motivation, and whether or not you have previous fitness tracker experience, we have recommendations for how to get the most out of your wearable.

The instruction manuals will give you the nuts and bolts of setting up your <a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/home\">Fitbit</a>, Garmin, Apple Watch, or any of the other popular fitness trackers on the market. What <em>we</em> want to do here is give some relevant, universal advice on incorporating your wearable fitness tracker into your life in a way that makes <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-exercise/\">exercise</a> more enjoyable and productive. It's all about <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/how-to-make-lasting-change/\">setting goals</a> and seeing them through. A fitness tracker can be a huge help.

<strong>How to Use Your Wearable Fitness Tracker</strong>

<strong>TIP #1: Don't treat it like a novelty</strong>. Your wearable fitness tracker is a shiny new object. And, like many shiny new objects, the tendency will be for your initial burst of enthusiasm to wane as the newness fades. Don't fall into this trap! Yes, you <em>could</em> fiddle with your wearable for fun, show it off to friends, and then lose interest.

But never forget that your tracker — for all its cool bells and whistles — is fundamentally a <em>tool</em>, not a toy. It is technology intended to help you measure progress and achieve goals. If you view it as entertainment, or a gimmick, or a fashion accessory... you'll almost certainly not get out of it what you could.

<strong>TIP #2: Find friends</strong>. One of the best things about your wearable is how it allows you to engage with fitness buddies like never before. You can initiate some healthy competition, share your own stats and achievement, participate in group challenges, and otherwise tap into the instant connectivity provided by the tracker and associated apps.

Research has long shown that people are likelier to stay motivated when <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/better/better/how-motivate-yourself-get-out-bed-work-out-today-ncna743006\">they have partners</a> in their health journeys. Sometimes it's a workout pal who's there at the gym with you or running alongside in the park. But in today's connected digital world, there are even more possibilities for peer interaction and motivation. Take advantage!

<strong>TIP #3: Be thoughtful about your goals</strong>. It's good to be ambitious when setting health goals. But it can be counterproductive to set goals that are <em>too</em> distant from your current performance levels. If you bite off more than you can chew (so to speak), you'll be more likely to get discouraged and quit.

Make a point of being thoughtful about setting incrementally bigger goals for yourself. For instance, try to take 5 percent more steps in your first week — not 50 percent. You'll have a better chance of getting to 50 percent eventually if you focus on creating healthy habits you can <em>manage and build upon</em>, rather than trying to do it all in one fell swoop.

Perhaps the single most important thing when using a fitness tracker is to stay encouraged. You want to set out to achieve goals that are a little beyond your comfort zone, but close enough to grasp without losing hope or focus. Your tracker can be an amazing motivator. But it's only as strategic as you are.

<strong>TIP #4: Don't get stuck on steps</strong>. Depending on the specific fitness wearable and apps you're using, the number of steps you take over the course of the day may be the baseline number you're tempted to focus on when thinking about movement milestones. And don't get us wrong: Steps are definitely useful to track!

But it's also important to remember that not all steps are created equal, and it's vital to pay attention to other metrics. After all, skipping the elevator and walking up six flights of stairs to get to the office is more physically challenging (and beneficial) than walking the same distance down the street to buy a doughnut. Even beyond how strenuous the activity is, spreading out 1,000 extra steps over the course of a day will have a different effect on your health than being sedentary for 10 consecutive hours and then taking a 1,000-step walk home.

Just be sure to put that step count into context. Make sure you're also paying attention to your heart rate, movement intervals, active calories burned, sleep pattern data, and all the other bits of information your wearable can provide. If you're diligent about meeting daily goals, the steps will take care of themselves!

<strong>TIP #5: Track your food</strong>. Exercise is only part of it. The more meticulous you are about carefully recording the food you eat, the more useful your overall fitness tracking will be. What you put into your body affects not just your health, but also your ability to work out, and the amount you <em>need</em> to work out. Use a quality nutrition app like MyFitnessPal to monitor your meals.

When they begin to track their nutrition on a daily basis, many people are stunned by what they notice. Foods you may assume are \"healthy\" are anything but! Your presumed caloric intake could be way off. You may be neglecting key nutrients while overindulging in <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/naturally_occurring_sugars_versus_added_sugars/\">hidden sugars</a>. And if your nutrition goals are not established and followed as closely as your fitness tracking, you could be off course.

More than anything, getting into the habit of tracking your food makes you more aware of what you're actually eating. Awareness breeds mindfulness and better choices.

<strong>TIP #6: Care about calories — to a point</strong>. When fitness tracking (or monitoring their nutrition), many people look first — and sometimes exclusively —  at the number of calories burned. That's understandable. Calories are common <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263028.php\">nutritional shorthand</a>, and it's important to have a basic awareness of how much energy you're consuming versus how much energy you're expending through exercise.

However, calories are only one measure of how healthy your diet is. Just like counting steps is a very useful but self-limiting view of overall fitness, so too is counting calories a very useful but self-limiting approach to nutrition. Watch your macronutrients (carbs, fats, proteins), be sure you're getting sufficient vitamins and minerals, and understand how to maximize the nutritional content of the calories you're consuming and burning.

<strong>TIP #7: Don't take it off</strong>. This is a <em>bit</em> of exaggeration. Obviously, there will be moments when it makes sense to remove your tracker. It shouldn't feel like you're under house arrest and wearing an ankle monitor!

But the more you wear your tracker, the more useful it will be to you, and the more acclimated you'll be to its feedback. The entire experience of tracking your fitness is intended to create new, sustainable habits. Having something new on your wrist may (at first) feel uncomfortable. The alerts may (at first) be annoying. However, with a little time, you will have integrated the device into your life, and using it will be second nature. That's why it's so critical to be consistent in wearing it early on. The mere act of wearing your fitness tracker is the healthy habit you must establish first!

<strong>TIP #8: Be proactive... but patient</strong>. That said, consistently wearing your tracker is <em>only</em> the first step. It's an incredible tool, but it's not magic! What do we mean by that? Well, however great Fitbit or Apple's technology is, it doesn't actually <em>do</em> the work for you. It measures and enhances and puts into context that work. But you can't tap the screen and instantaneously lose weight or sleep better.

Sustained improved health takes time! Stick with it. Figure out how best to use your fitness tracker to maximize its informational and motivational benefit to you. Guide it as much as it guides you. Make it an intuitive part of your day. You'll be amazed by the results if you let healthy habits take hold.

5233,1,"2018-01-05 19:29:57","2018-01-05 19:29:57","Water is <em>really</em> important. Good hydration is essential for every major body function and aspect of your health. There is no substitute for staying consistently <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/quest-for-hydration#1\">hydrated</a> with pure water. Water allows your body to regulate its temperature, flush wastes, prevent constipation, lubricate joints, and deliver nutrition to cells. It's central to brain, muscle, and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/best-foods-for-skin/\">skin health</a>. The liver and kidneys depend on it to detoxify the body. It facilitates healthy weight management. Hydration is a pillar of basic human performance.

<a href=\"https://eheintl.com/dehydration-symptoms\">Dehydration</a>, meanwhile, can be extremely detrimental. Your body naturally loses water through breathing, exercise, urination, and waste removal. When you aren't consuming sufficient water to replace the outgoing water, problems arise. At even one percent dehydration, you will begin to feel thirsty. Subsequent symptoms can include poor digestion and constipation, dizziness, foggy concentration, dry mouth, fatigue, and headaches. Headaches due to dehydration may also indicate increased bodily toxicity. Prolonged dehydration can crystalize the salts and minerals found in urine, potentially leading to painful kidney stones.

<strong>Tips For Good Hydration</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Drink pure water.</strong> Fruits, vegetables, and herbal teas are a big part of hydration, but regularly drinking pure water is still the easiest and most important step you can take to stay hydrated. Individual needs vary, but general guidelines recommend approximately 64 ounces of water per day for adults. Your physical activity, age, medical conditions, weight, and other factors all play a role in determining your optimal personal daily water intake. Check out this handy hydration <a href=\"http://www.h4hinitiative.com/tools/hydration-calculator\">calculator</a> for an estimate.</li>
 	<li><strong>Drink two to three glasses when you wake up </strong>to rehydrate after sleeping. Starting your day with hydration is always wise and gets you in the mindset of routinely sipping all day. Sipping hot lemon water in the morning actually has the added benefit of jump starting your <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/how_can_i_improve_my_digestive_health/\">digestion</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Flavor your water.</strong> Many people find water too bland, which becomes an excuse not to drink enough of it. Don't fall into this trap. If need be, add some lemon<strong>, </strong>lime, or a little fruit juice to your water if it helps make it more palatable. You can also add flavored vitamin C, or vitamin and mineral packets to your water, which can help you get the nutrition you need each day. Just make sure to avoid formulas with <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/naturally_occurring_sugars_versus_added_sugars/\">added sugars</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Emphasize hydrating foods. </strong>Fresh fruits, raw veggies, salads, and brothy soups are all hydrating and highly nutritious foods. Be sure to eat lots of fresh, natural foods. As always, avoid highly processed, sugary, and refined junk foods whenever possible.</li>
</ul>
Hydration keeps you healthy. It's one of the easiest (but most overlooked) elements of wellness. Remember to choose pure water: pollution and environmental contaminants can (and do) show up in our water supply, so filter your drinking water if you can. Since it’s best to <a href=\"http://www.breastcancer.org/risk/factors/plastic\">avoid plastics and BPA</a>, skip the bottled water and invest instead in a reusable stainless steel <a href=\"https://www.swellbottle.com\">water bottle</a>.

5237,1,"2018-01-28 20:03:29","2018-01-28 20:03:29","A morning cup of joe can be great, but if you want to <a href=\"https://www.livestrong.com/article/518058-the-disadvantages-of-caffeine/\">lower your caffeine intake</a>, there are plenty of great coffee alternatives that can still provide the energy (and comfort) of your daily coffee. It's not necessary to avoid caffeine entirely, but a coffee habit can quickly develop into caffeine <em>dependence</em>, especially if we're drinking it without really thinking. Taking the time to vary your routine with the coffee alternatives outlined below can be part of a larger <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/mindful-eating/\">mindful eating</a> approach that will change your relationship with nutrition for the better.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Green tea </strong>is the quintessential coffee substitute. <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/press_releases/benefit_of_drinking_green_tea\">Green tea</a> has a lot less caffeine than coffee, but still enough to give you a bit of an energy boost. This traditional Japanese tea is also packed with antioxidant health benefits from catechins, which are powerful disease fighters, and even more powerful than vitamins C and E in halting oxidative cellular damage. Green tea also contains L-theanine, which is great for focus.</li>
 	<li><strong>Teeccino </strong>is popular with those coming off strong coffee dependencies. It has a flavor and mouthfeel similar to coffee, but without the overstimulation of caffeine. <a href=\"http://teeccino.com/about/36/Teeccino-Health-Benefits.html\">Teeccino</a> is loaded with nutrients from fruits, nuts, grains, and herbs, and also contains soluble fiber from inulin. Unlike coffee, which can have a negative effect on gastrointestinal health, Teeccino is non-acidic, and the inulin (derived from chicory root) acts as a probiotic, feeding the good bacteria — bifidus and lactobacillus — as it travels through the large intestine.</li>
 	<li><strong>Yerba mate </strong>is made from the naturally caffeinated leaves of the South African holly tree. It will give you the caffeine boost of coffee, but without the crash. Yerba mate is also significantly more nutritious than coffee, with an antioxidant profile similar to green tea, but with even more powerful health-promoting compounds like fatty acids, carotene, chlorophyll, trace minerals, and 15 amino acids.</li>
 	<li><strong>Licorice tea </strong>is naturally caffeine-free, and has a bold, sweet, and spicy flavor profile. Licorice supports the adrenal glands, and is recommended as a stress-relieving compound. Licorice is also used to promote gastrointestinal health, soothe stomach ulcers and heartburn, and has anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.</li>
 	<li><strong>Siberian ginseng tea </strong>is a strong, somewhat bitter brew, and has long been used for energy, focus, concentration, and fatigue relief. It is also considered an <a href=\"https://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/adaptogens-explained/\">adaptogen</a>, and is used to boost stress resilience.</li>
 	<li><strong>Kombucha tea </strong>is known as a probiotic drink, but it is also high in B vitamins, particularly B12, which are fantastic for energy. Kombucha is also a great alternative for those looking to kick the sugary soda habit.</li>
 	<li><strong>Rooibos tea</strong> is low in tannins, and is a great, anti-inflammatory and caffeine-free alternative to coffee. It is also rich in antioxidants, and packed with flavonols, flavones, and flavanones, which may combat cancer cells.</li>
</ol>
If you like coffee, it may always be a part of your life in some way. But mixing in some of these coffee alternatives — or switching entirely — can help with your sleep, dental health, and mood. If you’ve decided to break your dependency on your daily cup (or five) of coffee, you have lots of alternatives to choose from to help energize, refresh, and nourish you throughout the day.

(Also, we'll remind you to try to avoid <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/energy_drinks_and_their_ingredients/\">energy drinks</a>, which are loaded with sugar <em>and</em> caffeine. If it's pure energy you're after, it's better to go with the more nutritious options <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/energy-foods/\">we outline here</a>!)

5240,1,"2018-01-15 08:00:15","2018-01-15 08:00:15","Sugar effects on health are significant and often poorly understood. While most people understand that too much <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sugar/\">sugar can be unhealthy</a>, they also continue to eat products with high amounts of hidden sugars, leading to performance problems with both mind and body. Cereals, energy bars, breads, bottled condiments and canned soups — these are just some of the common <a href=\"http://time.com/4252515/calories-processed-food/\">packaged and processed foods</a> with a surprising amount of added sugars, not to mention sodas and sweetened beverages. <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/naturally_occurring_sugars_versus_added_sugars/\">Added sugars</a> have harmful effects on metabolism and contribute to numerous diseases. There are many reasons why you may want to consider cutting added sugars out of your diet (or at least significantly limiting them).

<strong>But First: Know Your Sugars</strong>

Natural sugars from fruits, vegetables, and other whole foods come in a perfect package of fiber and nutrition, nourishing your body and keeping blood sugar levels stable. Refined and highly processed sugars are different. While minimal amounts of natural sweeteners — such as raw honey and maple syrup — have some nutritional value and are mostly safe in moderation, cutting out added sugars like refined white sugar and high fructose corn syrup is the best option. Managing your overall sugar intake is vital.

<strong>Sugar Effects on Your Health</strong>

<a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/news/2008/12/10/sugar-can-be-addictive-princeton-scientist-says\"><strong>Sugar can be addictive</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Sugar is chemically designed to be difficult to resist, and sugary foods are common binged. By stimulating the brain’s reward and appetite centers, fructose can inhibit satiety signals, making it difficult to moderate and limit intake.

<strong>Added sugars offer no nutrients</strong>, and bring no benefit to the body — no vitamins, minerals, essential fats, or proteins. Sugars like high fructose corn syrup and sucrose are calorie rich and nutrient poor. For this reason, they are often called “empty calories.\" High sugar consumption contributes to weight gain but often nutrient deficiencies.

<strong>Sugars mess with your brain. </strong>Eating added sugars gives your brain a major surge of feel-good dopamine, resulting in intense cravings. Sugars from whole foods like fresh fruits and vegetables don’t cause this same spike of dopamine. Over time, your brain requires greater amounts of sugar to get a “fix” from a surge of chemical pleasure. That's why the more sugar you eat, the more intense your cravings become.

<strong>Sugars prematurely age your skin. </strong>Too much sugar hinders collagen repair, resulting in glycation. Glycation occurs when sugar in your bloodstream attaches to proteins, forming harmful new molecules called advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Too much glycation negatively affects your skin’s collagen formation, thus determining how resistant your skin will be to wrinkle formation. In short, too much sugar makes you look older than your years.

<strong>Sugars contribute to stress. </strong>Research shows that sugars can lower the stress hormone, cortisol. When you binge on sweets and refined carbs, your risk for insulin resistance goes up, and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/holiday-stress/\">stress resilience</a> bottoms out. Healthy <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/stress-management/\">stress management techniques</a>, like exercise and meditation, are your best bet for finding your calm.

<strong>Excess sugars cause weight gain. </strong>It’s no secret that too much sugar makes us fatter. The liver metabolizes sugar and converts it to energy, but only to a point. The liver converts excess sugar to fat, raising your risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

<strong>Sugar destabilizes your energy levels. </strong>We all know the infamous sugar high is followed by the dreaded crash. And you may feel even more sluggish than you did before you indulged in that sugary treat. Instead of refined carbs and sugars, opt for fresh fruits and veggies, and high quality proteins, to raise your energy throughout the day.

<strong>Sugar is bad for your teeth. </strong>Sugars provide an easily digestible energy source for the bad bacteria in your mouth, contributing to bad breath, tooth decay, and enamel damage.

<strong>Sugar effects can include contributing to cancer. </strong><a href=\"http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/6/9/677.short\">Multiple studies link sugar consumption to a significantly higher risk of cancer</a>. Having constantly elevated insulin levels — a result of regular sugar consumption — can contribute to cancer, as insulin is a key hormone in regulating cell multiplication and growth.

The point is that sugar effects on your health are many, varied, and harmful. While it's difficult to eliminate all sugars from your diet, it's critical to regulate these negative sugar effects by moderating your consumption. Read nutrition labels. Plan your meals. Avoid relying on too many impulse snacks. You can have the occasional doughnut or ice cream sundae. The key is to treat yourself to one after making sure the meals and staples at the backbone of your diet aren't full of sugar themselves.

5243,1,"2017-12-20 08:00:23","2017-12-20 08:00:23","Like many people, you may be facing holiday travel. While it’s exciting to visit with family and friends, getting there and back can be <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/holiday-stress/\">stressful</a>. It can also be unhealthy. Congested traffic, flight delays, poor quality food, and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sleep-hygiene/\">disrupted sleep</a> can all take a toll on your health — especially if you are traveling by plane, which exposes you to germs in an enclosed space.

When preparing for holiday travel, it’s important to plan ahead for meals, exercise, and sleep routines, so that your body can stay strong during the festivities. The last thing you need is a <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/flu-symptoms/\">post-vacation cold or flu</a>. Let’s take a look at some tips for staying well as you embark on holiday travel.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Pack healthy snacks</strong>. More than half of air travelers buy food in airports. That can lead to fast food, candy, chips, and other less-than-healthy options which weaken your immune system and leave you vulnerable to illness. Instead, plan ahead! Bring apples, oranges, bananas, or a <a href=\"http://plantbaseddietitian.com/healthy-travel-tips/\">healthy meal</a> for the flight. If you do buy food in transit, the <a href=\"http://gateguru.com/\">GateGuru</a> app can help you locate healthy foods in your airport, and <a href=\"https://www.happycow.net/\">HappyCow</a> can help you find the best plant-based options. Opt for a fresh salad; some high-protein snacks like sliced veggies and hummus; raw, unsalted nuts; or high quality, low-sugar energy bars. Avoid packaged processed foods with added sugars and heavy oils, as well as sodas and alcohol. Bring an empty water bottle to fill once you get past security.</li>
 	<li><strong>Stay hydrated</strong>. Pure water, fresh fruit, and raw vegetables will keep you well-hydrated on the plane, and will help keep your sinuses from dehydrating — leaving you less susceptible to viruses. Try to drink plenty of water throughout your trip.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keep moving and stay active</strong>. If you have time before your flight, take a brisk lap around the terminal. If you're staying in a hotel, use the exercise room or swimming pool. Bodyweight exercises are excellent for holiday travel. They offer an effective, equipment-free, no-cost workout. All you need is 20 minutes and some space to move around. Bodyweight exercises include squats, lunges, sit-ups, burpees, planks, jumping jacks, push-ups, and bicycle crunches. You can create your own circuit workout: do 12 to 20 reps of each, with little rest in between. This will get your heart rate up while building strength.</li>
 	<li><strong>Prioritize sleep</strong>. Make sleep a top priority, especially during the nights before you travel. Aim for seven to nine full hours of sleep (absolutely no less than six), even when you're traveling, and take naps as needed. Sleep allows your body to heal, rest, and recharge each night, and is vital to good health and stress resilience. Research shows that skimping on sleep — even a few hours — leaves you more susceptible to catching a cold or flu the next day. And if you are taking a road trip to your destination, adequate sleep the night before is essential to staying alert while driving.</li>
 	<li><strong>Wash your hands</strong>. Frequent hand washing, especially during air travel, is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/why-handwashing.html\">key to avoiding viruses and infections</a>. When you cough or sneeze, do so in the crook of your elbow, and avoid touching your mouth, eyes, and nose unless you’ve washed your hands.</li>
 	<li><strong>Indulge mindfully</strong>. Enjoy your favorite holiday treats, just don’t overdo it. Fill 80 percent of your plate with steamed and fresh vegetables and fruits, and leave 20 percent for those foods you want to indulge in. Dark chocolate is a great indulgence that's easy to pack and has health benefits. If you want to avoid overly rich and sugary desserts, have a few squares after dinner, and really savor them.</li>
 	<li><strong>Enjoy yourself and manage stress</strong>. Take time to fully appreciate and enjoy the company of your loved ones. Focus on quality time and fun activities. If certain family members are a source of stress for you, take breaks. Go for a walk outside, catch a quick nap, or retreat for a meditation to reset when needed.</li>
</ol>
With a few simple strategies, you can enjoy holiday travel while keeping yourself healthy. The better you feel, the more energy you will have to enjoy the season.

<strong>EHE Health Coaching</strong>

An incredibly effective, convenient, and flexible service, especially for those patients with identified <em>health risks</em>. EHE has credentialed health coaches, educators, and nutritionists whose collective expertise covers virtually any identified health risk. Major focal points of coaching include physical activity, nutrition, weight management, stress management, prediabetes management, and smoking cessation.

Personal health coaches:
<ul>
 	<li>Work with patients for a <strong>full year</strong> after the EHE exam at <strong>no additional charge</strong> — it’s built into the program for anyone who wants it</li>
 	<li>Coach remotely by telephone, so it’s available no matter where the patient is</li>
</ul>
The initial session is called a “goals call,” during which the patient establishes what he or she wants to work on, identifies past challenges, current motivations, etc. Coaching can focus on one area or many areas — it’s entirely up to the patient. The entire process is patient-centric and designed to be encouraging, non-threatening, open, and flexible. Follow-up sessions are usually 15 to 20 minutes long and can be done on whatever schedule/frequency works best for the patient — weekly, biweekly, monthly, etc.

5298,1,"2017-12-28 08:00:48","2017-12-28 08:00:48","Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is officially classified as a \"specifier\" for a recurrent depressive mood disorder that occurs during a specific period of the year, almost always in winter, when the days are shorter, darker, and colder. While many people experience some form of winter blues, if the sadness and lethargy persists for more than a week or two and tends not to respond to physical exercise or activities you usually enjoy, you may be one of the million Americans <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder\">who suffer</a> from SAD.

Seasonal affective disorder is a type of <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/types-of-depression/\">depression</a>. Most people with SAD experience the onset of symptoms during the fall and winter months, although it is possible to have seasonal affective disorder in the spring and summer. The symptoms can be profound and debilitating, and they worsen as the season progresses. These effects include fatigue, loss of pleasure, difficulty concentrating, and overeating <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sugar/\">sugar</a> and high carbohydrate foods.

The symptoms of seasonal affective disorder may fade with the arrival the next season, but the havoc they cause during can be severe. You may be left overweight, in poor physical condition, and with strained interpersonal relationships. Additional symptoms may include:
<ul>
 	<li>Prolonged sadness, irritability, and anxiety</li>
 	<li>Feelings of hopelessness</li>
 	<li>Sleep disturbances (sleeping too much or too little)</li>
 	<li>Decreased sex drive</li>
 	<li>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt</li>
 	<li>Suicidal thoughts</li>
 	<li>Angry outbursts</li>
 	<li>Apathy</li>
 	<li>Social isolation</li>
</ul>
Seasonal affective disorder in the fall and winter tends to feature the symptoms of oversleeping, overeating, extreme fatigue, and trouble in relationships. When seasonal affective disorder arrives in the spring, symptoms are inclined toward insomnia, decreased appetite, and weight loss.

<strong>What Helps Seasonal Affective Disorder?</strong>

The causes of seasonal affective disorder are not entirely known. There may be several different contributing factors, such as a sensitivity to decreased sunlight or changes in the body’s natural circadian rhythms leading to shifts in serotonin levels.

Some people find antidepressant medications and talk therapy helpful. Many doctors prescribe light therapy, also known as phototherapy. With light therapy, patients are exposed to natural and artificial lights, called <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/in-depth/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/ART-20048298\">light boxes</a>, on a daily basis. The therapy works by activating cells in the retina which connect to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that helps regulate circadian rhythms. The majority of patients treated with phototherapy see marked improvement as soon as four days after beginning treatment. It's also important to maintain a regular sleep schedule, and maximize your exposure  to natural daylight. Wake up early, open your curtains right away, and spend some time outside each day — particularly in the early morning hours.

While light therapy is an effective <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/basics/treatment/con-20021047\">treatment for SAD</a>, it may not be appropriate or helpful for everyone. Some people respond well to more (or brighter) light, but not everyone. Individuals with bipolar disorder may experience mania or hypomania when exposed to bright light, and those with <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/diabetes-symptoms/\">diabetes</a> or other pre-existing eye conditions should check with their doctor before beginning phototherapy. Remember that SAD, like other forms of depression, can have different causes. You have options when it comes to selecting the best treatment plan. The key is to establish a good relationship with a mental health professional who can help guide your progress.

5311,1,"2018-01-03 08:00:35","2018-01-03 08:00:35","\"How do I boost my immunity?\" It's a question that gets asked all the time, but especially during <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/flu-shot/\">flu season</a> and colder months when everyone you know seems to be coming down with something.

A vigorous immune system readily fights off pathogens and invaders, but if we are run down by nutrient poor diets, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/relaxation-therapy/\">stress overload</a>, or lack of quality sleep, our chances of getting sick increase. Luckily, there are simple, daily lifestyle adjustments you can make to support your immune system and optimize its ability to battle infection.

<strong>Increase the whole foods and plants in your diet. </strong>Vitamins A, C, E, and D, minerals zinc and selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids are vital to a functioning immune system. Whenever possible, choose whole, natural foods. High quality proteins, a wide array of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, raw nuts and seeds are all good options. Stay hydrated with plenty of pure water. Avoid soft drinks, processed foods, fried foods, artificial sweeteners, trans fats, fast food, and refined starches and sugars. For an added immune boost, you can supplement with astragalus, reishi mushroom, bee pollen, and spirulina and microalgae.

<strong>Eat organic. </strong>Poor quality diets leave us nutrient-depleted and are a cause of weakened immune response. Fresh fruits and vegetables contain numerous vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals that are essential for vibrant health. Citrus fruits, dark leafy greens, berries, broccoli, tomatoes, papaya, and red peppers are among the many fruits and veggies loaded with vitamin C: a major immunity booster. Purchasing organic products as often as possible reduces your exposure to carcinogenic <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9498903\">pesticides</a>. If you’re shopping on a budget, check out the <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/#.Wdf9QWhSzIU\">Dirty Dozen and Clean 15</a>, which lists the produce items most (and least) contaminated with pesticide residues.<strong> </strong>

<strong>Manage your stress levels. </strong>Did you know that prolonged stress can lower the body’s disease-fighting white blood cell count? While some stress is normal and can even motivate us, excessive or chronic stress can be exhausting, leaving us run down and vulnerable to infection and illness. Learning to manage stress well is a key component of healthy immunity. Meditate, spend time with loved ones and pets, exercise, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/what_are_the_types_of_yoga/\">do yoga</a>, and focus as much as you can on the things that bring you happiness. A therapist (or a trusted friend) call also serve as a good sounding board.

<strong>Emphasize probiotics for a healthy gut. </strong><a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/research/advancements-in-research/fundamentals/in-depth/the-gut-where-bacteria-and-immune-system-meet\">A healthy GI tract is key</a> to a strong immunity. Probiotics are essential to maintaining great gut health. Balanced intestinal flora contribute to better nutrient absorption, and help keep the intestinal lining strong, forming a barrier against pathogenic microbes and other harmful substances. Probiotics help alleviate inflammation in the gut, which also supports healthy immunity and digestion. Eat probiotic-rich foods, such as kimchi and sauerkraut, and take a high quality probiotic supplement every day.

<strong>Commit to exercise you enjoy. </strong>Getting moderate to vigorous exercise every day is one of the most important things we can do for our health. The key is to avoid overtraining, which can add to your body’s stress levels. It's vital to exercise in ways you genuinely like. You don’t want exercise to be one more chore you dread doing. Yoga can be excellent exercise for immunity. It promotes relaxation and a healthy stress response, helps lower stress hormones that negatively impact the immune system, and stimulates the lymphatic system to give toxins the boot.

<strong>Prioritize sleep. </strong>Getting enough sleep is integral to good immune function. Aim for seven to nine hours of uninterrupted sleep a night, so your body can fully rest, repair, and charge up for the coming day. Practice good <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sleep-hygiene/\">sleep hygiene</a> habits. Take an hour (at least) to wind down before bed. Play soothing music or read a good book. Sip on some <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/toby-nwazor/6-natural-tea-remedies-fo_b_10619928.html\">herbal tea</a>, like chamomile, peppermint, or passion flower, which have relaxation-promoting compounds. Invest in cozy sheets, pillows, and blankets, and use a sleep mask, or blackout curtains, so that you sleep in complete darkness. You want your bedroom to be a comforting, restful retreat; keep devices, televisions, and computers in other parts of the house. Quality sleep will supercharge your immunity.

5433,1,"2017-12-26 15:06:50","2017-12-26 15:06:50","<strong>Are You Getting Enough Vitamin D?</strong>

<a href=\"https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/about-vitamin-d/how-do-i-get-the-vitamin-d-my-body-needs/\">Vitamin D</a> is the “sunshine vitamin”, and the array of health benefits it provides is significant. The two primary ways to get vitamin D are by exposing your skin directly to sunlight, or through supplementation. <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/features/the-truth-about-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-food-sources\">Vitamin D containing foods</a> are also helpful, but do not provide adequate levels of this crucial nutrient on their own. Studies have found that vitamin D’s impact on our overall good health should not be underestimated: it affects as many as 2000 genes throughout the body. Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin in a cluster of compounds that includes vitamins D1, D2, and D3. Without sufficient levels of this vitamin in our bloodstreams, we are at risk for bone abnormalities, cognitive decline, compromised immune function, increased inflammation, and even mood disorders. Let’s take a closer look at this nutrient powerhouse, and some of the benefits it provides.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Immune System Support</strong> - By stimulating production of crucial peptides in white blood cells, and epithelial cells which line the respiratory tract, vitamin D helps ward off colds and flu, and protects the lungs from infection. Vitamin D may also modulate the immune response, and strengthen overall immunity.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reduces Depression Symptoms</strong> - Research shows that vitamin D is a powerful way to support depression sufferers, as it helps regulate mood. Studies also suggest that vitamin D3 may be helpful for treating symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD), in conjunction with light therapy (phototherapy), during the winter months when exposure to sunlight decreases in certain regions.</li>
 	<li><strong>Maintains the Health of Teeth and Bones </strong>- By assisting in the absorption of calcium, Vitamin D promotes optimal bone density and dental health.</li>
 	<li><strong>Aids in Diabetes Management </strong>- Vitamin D helps regulate insulin levels, keeping blood sugar levels stable.</li>
 	<li><strong>Boosts Weight Loss</strong> - Receptors in the brain rely on vitamin D to keep hunger and food cravings in check, and to keep mood-elevating serotonin flowing. Vitamin D also optimizes the body’s absorption of many weight-loss boosting nutrients, particularly calcium. When our bodies are deficient in calcium, synthase, a fatty acid which converts calories to fat, can increase up to five times its normal amount. Vitamin D fueled nutrients help shift our bodies from fat storage mode, to fat burning mode, helping us shift any excess weight we may be carrying.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Supplementing With Vitamin D</strong>

Research suggests that up to 75 percent of the US population is <a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms#section2\">vitamin D deficient</a>, so it's safe to assume that virtually anyone is at risk of deficiency, especially during the winter months. Due to widespread sun avoidance, the majority of our days spent indoors, and sunscreen use to prevent skin cancers, most of us aren’t getting enough vitamin D through natural means. Vitamin D is a vital nutrient, so supplementation makes sense. The most natural way to make vitamin D is to expose your bare skin to sunlight for about half the time it takes to develop a sunburn - tanning is not necessary. However, dermatologists do not recommend the risk of exposure to potentially cancer-causing UV radiation, and <a href=\"http://news.cancerconnect.com/choosing-a-vitamin-d-supplement/\">supplementation</a> combined with vitamin D rich foods like salmon, mackerel, egg yolks, and mushrooms is recommended instead.","Vitamin D","","draft","open","open","","","","","2017-12-27 14:41:37","2017-12-27 14:41:37","",0,"https://eheintl.com/?p=5433",0,"post","",0

Dr. Elliott helped clear up some common misconceptions about the use of essential oils. For one thing, <em>don't ingest them</em>. They're not the same as edible extracts! Also important: If you're applying the oils topically, dilute them first. Do <em>not</em> put concentrated oils on your skin, where they act as contact allergens.

She also educated Ray and her audience on the dangers of wearing a charcoal mask with an adhesive. Instead, Dr. Elliott demonstrated how to mix charcoal powder with sea salt and rosewater for a safe, do-it-yourself exfoliator to use for just five minutes, twice a week.

5448,1,"2018-01-04 08:00:59","2018-01-04 08:00:59","Your standard protein shake can be chalky, flavorless, and the <i>last</i> thing you feel like drinking... no matter <em>how</em> good it may be for you.

That's why we've created an energizing protein shake that is not just nutritious, but also delicious. Adding espresso to the mix makes this protein shake the perfect morning or pre-workout drink to boost your energy and get you vital nutrients.

As we've emphasized in the past, caffeine is <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/energy_drinks_and_their_ingredients/\">no substitute</a> for the energy you get from a healthy lifestyle. But moderate consumption of espresso can <a href=\"https://www.caffeineinformer.com/top-10-caffeine-health-benefits\">benefit your health</a> in a number of ways. It's been shown to improve long-term memory, maintain dopamine levels, and facilitate focus.

We recommend drinking the shake about one hour before exercising. Just remember: You can have too much of a good thing, and consuming excessive caffeine can lead to anxiety, sleeplessness, and other negative consequences. Try not to exceed two cups per day.

The more important component in this shake is the protein. Getting enough protein can be challenging during busy days, especially since most people rely on animal protein, which can involve a lot more preparation. By adding organic protein powder to a morning or afternoon meal, you'll increase satiety and help ensure that your body gets what it needs.

Specifically, our body needs protein to produce hormones, repair tissues, and maintain healthy bones and metabolic function. We recommend choosing an organic variety sourced from pea, grass-fed whey, hemp, or brown rice. Watch for <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/naturally_occurring_sugars_versus_added_sugars/\">added sugars</a> and other ingredients you don't recognize.

Chia literally means \"strength,\" and was used as an energy booster in ancient Aztec society. Adding chia seeds to this smoothie is the perfect way to boost its nutrient content. Chia seeds expand and form a gel-like substance in the stomach, helping to satiate and prevent overeating. They also have a concentration of omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/digestive_health_fiber/\">fiber</a>.

5460,1,"2018-01-05 21:57:37","2018-01-05 21:57:37","How to motivate others to make some of the healthy choices you're making? It's not so easy. Anyone who's found it difficult to get on the right path understands the frequent resistance of their loved ones to adopt similar lifestyle changes. Despite intellectually understanding the <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-exercise/\">benefits of exercise</a>, for instance, they may feel too busy or hopelessly behind to start a fitness routine. No one doubts the power of <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/healthy-eating-patterns/\">eating healthy</a>, but many of people are caught in dietary ruts and haven't been sufficiently motivated to change.

But your friends, family, and colleagues have a secret weapon: <em>you</em>.

You're proof that someone they know can break bad habits and start good ones. You're actively looking for articles like this one, and therefore <em>motivated</em> to motivate them. Unlike wellness gurus they may see on book covers or television, you're in their lives and in their corner. That's incredibly powerful, as are some of the specific ways you can be a daily or weekly motivational presence for people who know they need to get healthier but haven't had the right personal nudge in that direction quite yet.

Here are some thoughts on how to motivate others:
<ol>
 	<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Help them find the \"why.\" </strong>Get clear on <em>why</em> better health is important to them. Maybe they're tired of their clothes not fitting. Maybe they're managing a health condition that requires better habits. Maybe it's vanity. Maybe it's a desire for more energy or better sleep or a prolonged life or higher performance. Maybe it's general prevention. Maybe it's something else. Regardless, the key is to connect them with a specific goal that feels personal. They will be more likely to take steps toward a destination when they've said, out loud, where they'd like to go.</li>
 	<li><strong>Listen</strong>. It may seem obvious, but it's essential. Use your own suggestions as motivation where appropriate, but actually <em>hear</em> what the other person is saying about what they want out of a different habit. Don't replace their story with your own. The more you understand their rationale, obstacles, fears, and desires, the easier the entire process will be.</li>
 	<li><strong>Incentivize the process. </strong>If it’s been a while since they exercised, you may suggest a small system of self-bribery. This is especially true in pursuing the small bits of progress that ultimately add up to something like a smaller waist size. Try to come up with a <a href=\"http://time.com/4226640/exercise-workout-fitness-incentives/\">rewards system</a> that's built into your relationship with the person you hope to motivate. For instance, if you live with them, say you'll watch a show or movie of their choice after a healthy dinner together. If it's a friend, offer to take them out to lunch after they hit the gym. Figure out the best “<a href=\"http://dailyburn.com/life/fitness/train-to-win-achieve-fitness-goals/\">habit loop</a>” that makes sense for them. Habit loops involve a cue or trigger for the desired new behavior, the routine, and then the reward. If they've found that similar tricks haven't worked when they've tried to use them, it's possible that having someone <em>else</em> as the protector/dispenser of rewards will provide the extra incentive they need to actually get the job done.</li>
 	<li><strong>Don't be a scold or perfectionist</strong>. There's a reason you're helping to motivate someone — because change is difficult, and progress doesn't always go in a straight line. If and when there's a hiccup in the process, use it as an opportunity to refocus the person you're motivating on the big picture. While there's no one right way to motivate, the <em>least</em> productive \"how to motivate\" approach is one that involves shame or negativity or asking the other person to reach impossibly high expectations. Build some looseness and flexibility into your motivation.</li>
 	<li><strong>Do be gently insistent</strong>. Try not to let them delay or slip out of their new commitment without explanation. Flexibility is good, but so are specific plans and start dates. Make it clear that life can interfere with plans and people are allowed the occasional day of laziness, but that this commitment is a commitment and means something to you. When they understand that you're part of this, supportive but firm, they'll take it more seriously themselves.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ask them to sign a contract</strong> committing to exercise or healthier eating. Act as a \"witness.\" When promises are put into writing, in the presence of another, they can feel more real. If feasible, put a (healthy, reasonable) penalty into the contract, whereby your loved one will donate to charity or take care of a long-delayed task if they skip a workout or ignore their nutritional goals during the week. The contract should be specific in outlining the exercise and/or eating habits. Again, externalizing and publicizing these goals can put the right kind of pressure on someone to follow through.</li>
 	<li><strong>Don’t trip over positive thinking. </strong>Positive thinking, or visualizing the results you want as a motivational exercise, is great. That said, there is a caveat to be aware of in order for their visualizations to work. Once you’re clear on the outcome(s) they want, like toned muscles or amazing energy, help them to identify their internal blocks or resistance to change, and strategize as to how they will overcome these barriers to success. If they know they’re more likely to follow through with exercise during a certain time of day, for instance, make sure they focus on that window of opportunity.</li>
 	<li><strong>Be a workout or meal buddy</strong>. This, more than anything else, is a practical way to help someone achieve real progress. Actually <em>do</em> the thing with them. Offer to go to the gym, take a fitness class, or share meals. Bicycle together or cook together. Mutual support and accountability are powerful ways to keep their momentum fired up over time. Research shows that fitness clubs, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/join-adult-recreational-sports-team/\">recreational sports teams</a>, and workout partners increase exercise compliance, weight loss, and commitment to goals in the long term. Fitness buddies help you enjoy your workouts more, and can offer support navigating slumps and discouraged moments along the way.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
There is no doubt that that making changes for the better requires commitment, and there may be times when your friends and family feel uninspired or unmotivated. Know that you will encounter those moments, and set them up for success by implementing tools and strategies that will keep them moving, even when the going gets tough.

5467,1,"2018-01-15 22:27:58","2018-01-15 22:27:58","How to meditate if you're just starting out? Well, it's important to understand there's no one \"right\" way to meditate. There are countless variations, developed over centuries, with different techniques and goals. There's even <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/walking-meditation/\">walking meditation</a>, proving you don't need to be still to be meditative! There are other methods for relaxation and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/stress-relief/\">stress relief</a>, but a regular meditation routine is one of the <a href=\"https://nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm\">best ways to ensure</a> you have sustained balance, mindfulness, and calm amid the pressures of modern life.

What we want to offer here are some recommendations on how to meditate — not comprehensive, not exclusive, and very much open to interpretation. But if you want to get started with a simple meditation practice, here is one relatively easy way to start practicing.

<strong>How to Meditate</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Sit in a comfortable, quiet space. Use a cushion or a chair if necessary.</li>
 	<li>Keep your posture straight. Rest your hands on your lap.</li>
 	<li>Close your eyes.</li>
 	<li>Breathe naturally for a minute or two, and let your heart rate slow.</li>
 	<li>Focus on your breathing. Take notice of your inhalation and exhalation, especially how your body responds to each.</li>
 	<li>Stay in this intensely, internally observant mode.</li>
 	<li>Take inventory of your body, starting at the top of your head, working down to your toes, and observing the sensations in different parts.</li>
 	<li>If your mind wanders, direct it back to the \"present.\"</li>
 	<li>Focus again on your respiration. Focus again on your body.</li>
</ul>
<em>Try this for 10 minutes at a time, then 15, and, once you're acclimated to the process, establish a 20-minute daily session.</em>

<strong>Additional Tips on How to Meditate</strong>

<em>Eliminate distractions</em>: If your body is comfortable and your space quiet, it will be much easier to stay focused.

<em>Stick to a schedule</em>: It's all about establishing habits. If you set aside 20 minutes for meditation, at roughly the same time, every day, it will become part of your routine.

<em>Learn more</em>: There are meditation classes in virtually every town and city. Some styles may suit you better, and some instructors may help you reach a level of mindfulness you find difficult to reach on your own. While it's not necessary to seek outside training, be aware of the options.

<em>It's about you</em>: Well, it's about you and the universe and everything in between. But what we mean is, don't worry about doing things the \"right\" way, or with the \"right\" people. Find what works for you.

<em>Cut yourself slack</em>: Meditation is not the most natural activity. Anyone can do it, but it takes practice. We aren't used to being still, concentrating on the moment, setting aside our ongoing worries, and letting our breath direct our thoughts. All of that is to say: Don't get discouraged if it takes you a handful of sessions to start to get the hang of it! It's all a process.

5543,1,"2018-02-10 01:25:05","2018-02-10 01:25:05","Health coaching benefits people in a variety of amazing ways. Whatever your wellness goals, a good coach can help you reach them. Here are some of the big ways in which a health coach can make all the difference.

<strong>Expertise</strong>: There’s perhaps no resource more valuable than your coach’s knowledge — and his or her ability to convey that knowledge to you. A coach will distill the most important advice for any health journey, cutting through a lot of the contradictory information you may have heard to give you the most effective, up-to-date, and actionable advice. It’s expertise you can trust.

<strong>Experience</strong>: The plan you devise with your health coach is tailored to your needs and circumstances. But there's no substitute for the experience the coach has acquired working with countless other patients, even if their own plans looked nothing like your own. Coaches understand how to handle any situation that develops, how to motivate, how to communicate, and how to adapt.

<strong>Accountability</strong>: Being in regular contact with someone does wonders for your motivation. Aside from the coach's expertise, merely having an objective person involved in your goal-setting and progress makes the process far likelier to succeed. Externalizing your intentions — discussing them openly with a coach, instead of just letting them bounce around your head — is one of the keys to putting forward the effort required to follow through on them. A health coach makes you accountable.

<strong>Big Picture Thinking</strong>: It's all too easy for us to get discouraged by short-term failure when pursuing health goals. A health coach helps to keep our eyes on the prize. Progress will not always follow a straight line. Coaching keeps us on track with a plan, which is essential to maintaining momentum, even through the tough moments.

<strong>Partnership</strong>: A health coach is your partner in a journey toward wellness. At the end of the day, having another person walk with you, step by step, as you attempt to elevate your quality of healthy living, makes the experience less lonely and more engaging. Your friends and family support you, and a coach doesn't replace the emotional lift you can get from loved ones. But having a partner whose <em>only</em> interest is your health progress can be uniquely beneficial.

Ultimately, health coaching benefits you by making you more educated and confident about the process of sustaining healthy habits over the long term. Regular contact with an expert makes you likelier to maintain momentum and positive results, even after the period of coaching ends. In this way, health coaching actually becomes one of the best ways to ensure long-term self-sufficiency.

If you're an EHE patient, we really encourage you to use our health coaching program. It's an opportunity to learn more than you ever have about what goes into good health and holistic, preventive care. It helps you identify goals and stay on track. It enhances your <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/program-overview/patient-experience/\">journey toward wellness</a>.

5571,1,"2018-02-08 21:09:25","2018-02-08 21:09:25","Is dark chocolate healthy? While we wouldn't exactly call it a superfood, dark chocolate does have some remarkable health benefits, making it a good choice for dessert. It is loaded with <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/the_13_essential_vitamins/\">vitamins</a>, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/anti-aging-foods/\">flavonols</a>, and antioxidants, and as we outline below, dark chocolate has plenty of other advantages.

Just to be clear: We're not talking about the processed, sugar-laden candy bars you'll find in the supermarket checkout aisle. We mean high-quality dark chocolate with at least 60 percent cocoa content.

What makes dark chocolate healthy? Check out some of its benefits:
<ol>
 	<li><a href=\"http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/dark-chocolate-serotonin-levels-5558.html\"><strong>Dark chocolate is a mood-booster</strong></a>. Dark chocolate is full of compounds that can help prevent <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/types-of-depression/\">depression</a>, such as anandamide, which is structurally similar to THC but much milder. Anandamide can give you a good mood and energy lift, without the potential health concerns that come with other stimulating substances. Chocolate also contains phenylethylamine, which converts to mood lifting and stabilizing serotonin in the body.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://www.prevention.com/food/healthy-eating-tips/dark-chocolate-and-antioxidants-0\"><strong>Dark chocolate is loaded with antioxidants</strong></a>, and provides excellent free-radical protection. There are more polyphenols and flavonoids present in dark chocolate than in either tea or wine. These help neutralize free radicals, and shield the body from their potential damage.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/health/medical-research/info-03-2011/dark-chocolate-can-help-lower-your-blood-pressure.html\"><strong>Dark chocolate can lower blood pressure</strong></a>. The flavonols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium (the lining of arteries) to produce nitric oxide, which then signals the arteries to relax. This lowers resistance to blood flow, thereby lowering blood pressure.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/can-chocolate-be-good-for-you.html\"><strong>Dark chocolate may help prevent cancer</strong></a>. The rich supply of flavonoids in dark chocolate may account for its potential cancer-fighting properties. While studies are still emerging, they suggest that chocolate’s antioxidant properties possibly protect against free radical cellular damage that leads to cancer formation.</li>
 	<li><strong>Flavonols favorably impact heart health</strong>. Eating flavonoid-rich dark chocolate is good for your heart. A study published in the <em>International Journal of Cardiology</em> reports that dark chocolate intake considerably improved heart circulation in healthy adults. The compounds in dark chocolate are also significantly protective against the oxidation of LDL, which causes less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries over time.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16702322\"><strong>Dark chocolate may protect your skin against the sun</strong></a>. Flavonols can protect against sun damage, and also improve blood flow to the skin.</li>
 	<li><strong>Dark chocolate is amazing brain food</strong>. One study showed that five days of high-flavonol dark cocoa consumption improved blood flow to the brain in healthy volunteers. Another study reports that dark chocolate consumption improved cognitive and verbal function in elderly adults with mental impairment.</li>
</ol>
While fresh fruit, vegetables, and tea are known as fantastic sources of antioxidants (and you should <em>definitely</em> consume lots of them), research shows that the cocoa bean is an even more potent source. It features one of the highest concentrations of nutrients and antioxidants of any food. That makes dark chocolate healthy, as long as you enjoy it in moderation. Your best bet is to buy 100 percent cocoa or raw cacao powder, and add it to your smoothies, whole grain cereals, or low-sugar homemade dishes. If you go with bars that are at least 60 to 70 percent cocoa, one to three squares per day is all you need to enjoy the benefits.

5574,1,"2018-02-06 21:55:44","2018-02-06 21:55:44","<strong>Why You Might Want to Ditch Your Caffeine Routine</strong>

<strong> </strong>

Caffeine is type of psychoactive drug found in coffee, teas, sodas, chocolate, and energy drinks, and is generally considered safe in moderate amounts; billions of people worldwide enjoy a caffeinated beverage (or a few) each day. We’re not suggesting you forever ditch your favorite latte, but, given the benefits of cutting out caffeine, you might want to.

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Decreased jitters. </strong>Caffeine affects the central nervous system. It also stimulates the adrenal glands which release cortisol and activate the body’s fight-or-flight response. Many people report increased anxiety levels with caffeine consumption. Quitting caffeine can help you feel less anxious; especially if you are prone to panic or anxiety disorders.</li>
 	<li><strong>Fewer headaches. </strong><a href=\"https://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-headache\">Caffeine often triggers headaches</a>, and even migraines. This is a major reason why switching up your daily caffeine routine can cause withdrawal headaches. If you have a major caffeine habit and quit cold turkey, you might get some intense symptoms. This is why weaning off caffeine over time works best for some people.</li>
 	<li><strong>Better sleep. </strong>Even in small amounts, caffeine blocks the calm-inducing neurotransmitters that make you feel sleepy. Consuming caffeine after 12 noon is a common cause of poor and disrupted sleep patterns. Drinking coffee and energy drinks late in the day often hinders quality sleep, as it can take 4 to 7 hours for caffeine to fully work through your system.</li>
 	<li><strong>Healthier teeth. </strong>Eliminating acidic, caffeinated drinks results in healthier, whiter teeth: coffee and tea stain, and sugary sodas and energy drinks erode enamel and contribute to tooth decay.</li>
 	<li><strong>Are you addicted? </strong>Caffeine is a psychoactive drug with addictive properties. It can cause some degree of physical dependency, which is why many people experience withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, nausea, flu-like symptoms, and impaired concentration once they quit. <a href=\"https://www.caffeineinformer.com/is-caffeine-addictive\">Caffeine is not considered a major addictive drug</a>; but many people quit the stuff due to its drawbacks, and don’t like the dependency created by leaning on it for energy every day.</li>
 	<li><strong>Lessen hypertension. </strong>Caffeine can raise your blood pressure, so quitting contributes to lower blood pressure, and lessens the workload for your heart.</li>
 	<li><strong>Improve your mood. </strong>Caffeine consumption can cause irritability and anxiety in some people, and many people feel a slump in mood and energy if they miss their routine cup of coffee. Quitting caffeine can contribute to feelings of calm, and may even out your mood and energy levels.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>Does Caffeine Offer Benefits? </strong>

<strong> </strong>

Some studies suggest that moderate caffeine consumption may reduce depression in women, and lessen the risk of dementia, Parkinson’s, type 2 diabetes, and stroke. A longitudinal Harvard study reports that caffeine consumption is not linked to increased mortality. While there may be some benefits to caffeine consumption, there are also negative effects in some people; like restlessness, irritability, sweaty palms, higher blood pressure, and heartburn. Caffeine may also act as a diuretic in high quantities, and can cause mild dehydration.

&nbsp;

You may not need to quit caffeine totally, or you might find you feel best if you kick the habit entirely. If you do quit, you may experience withdrawal symptoms lasting two to nine days or so. Some people find that <a href=\"https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-9165/how-to-quit-caffeine-in-one-week-painlessly.html\">weaning off coffee or caffeine</a> over days or weeks is a more manageable solution.

5576,1,"2018-02-13 17:06:12","2018-02-13 17:06:12","Heart disease symptoms may not be obvious. You might be vulnerable to cardiovascular issues but not realize it, especially if you haven't gotten recent screenings. Silent or atypical heart attack symptoms are <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/WarningSignsofaHeartAttack/Heart-Attack-Symptoms-in-Women_UCM_436448_Article.jsp#.WoMRdsaZOMJ\">especially prevalent in women</a> and too frequently overlooked.

Great awareness about the importance of a healthy lifestyle and advances in treatment methods have helped many people avoid heart disease or recover from it. That said, the risk is still sky high. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States. <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/features/never-ignore-symptoms#1\">Recognizing</a> these heart disease symptoms early can help you steer clear of disaster and motivate you to adopt healthier habits.

<strong>You’re really, really tired. </strong>This is not typical fatigue, or simply feeling tired from <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sleep-hygiene/\">lack of sleep</a>. Fatigue associated with heart disease is extreme, and doesn’t go away. If your heart is struggling to deliver oxygen to other parts of your body, you will feel unusual levels of lingering exhaustion.

<strong>Walking becomes painful. </strong>This pain can become extreme, and shouldn’t be dismissed. Cramping in the hips and legs that occurs when moving, walking, or climbing (but improves with rest) may be a sign of peripheral arterial disease, also called PAD. PAD occurs when there is fatty plaque buildup in the arteries of the legs. PAD is serious, but responds well to treatment.

<strong>You feel dizzy at random times. </strong>This symptom has many non-heart related causes, but feeling faint or dizzy at random times may mean your heart is struggling. You may have an irregular heartbeat, or you may be at risk of heart attack. Dizziness can be caused by blocked arteries that lessen blood pressure, or faulty valves struggling to maintain blood pressure.

<strong>Your feet swell. </strong>If your feet are sore, painful, and swollen, with no obvious explanation, your heart could be in trouble. Heart-related foot swelling will typically be accompanied by other symptoms such as sudden weight gain, extreme fatigue, and shortness of breath.

<strong>You have episodes of sudden anxiety and nausea. </strong>The classic symptoms of a panic attack, such as anxiety, nausea, shortness of breath, and sudden sweating, can also indicate heart attack. You may also feel fatigue, pain and fullness in the chest that may radiate to the back, neck, jaw, throat, or shoulders. Get to the emergency room immediately if these symptoms are present. Do <strong>not</strong> wait. Those who arrive at the hospital within one hour of heart attack symptoms have the best chance of survival.

<strong>You’re experiencing exercise intolerance. </strong>If you start feeling winded or unable to easily complete physical tasks you’re used to doing, like climbing stairs and working out, your heart may be in distress. If you suddenly need more rest after your normal physical activities, it might be smart to get your heart checked, especially if exercise intolerance occurs with other symptoms.

<strong>You’re depressed. </strong><a href=\"https://eheintl.com/types-of-depression/\">Depression</a> is not necessarily a sign of heart disease, but people who have heart disease, or increased risk factors for heart disease, tend to be depressed. Check with your doctor if you’re depressed, especially if other symptoms are present.

<strong>There is pain in your back, arms, or chest. </strong>If you suddenly have significant new pain, whether or not it feels like the typical chest heaviness, check in with your doctor. Heart muscle cells run out of oxygen during a heart attack because of blocked arteries, triggering pain signals throughout the nervous system. The brain may confuse these nerve signals as coming from the back, chest, or either arm, due to nerve proximity with the heart muscle.

<strong>Your stomach or gastrointestinal tract is upset. </strong>Heart disease can present as nausea, vomiting, indigestion, or GI distress, especially in women. If you’re feeling particularly unwell, it’s always a good idea to check in with your healthcare provider.

The guiding principle is to listen to your body. If something doesn't feel right, don't ignore it. These heart disease symptoms overlap with other conditions, so don't <em>assume</em> you are in serious cardiovascular trouble just because you have one or two of them. But monitor them closely and, if they persist, talk to a doctor. And remember to reduce your risk of heart disease by <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/quick_thought_smoking_cessation/\">quitting smoking</a>, maintaining a healthy weight, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/stress-management/\">minimizing stress</a>, and eating a nutritious.

5578,1,"2018-02-20 00:57:12","2018-02-20 00:57:12","Vascular screening helps you assess your risk of cardiovascular disease by checking your blood vessels. Healthy blood vessels are elastic and smooth, allowing blood to flow easily through them. Heart disease causes weak spots in the vessels, as well as possible narrowing or blockage. A vascular screening <a href=\"https://vascular.org/news-advocacy/svs-position-statement-vascular-screening\">detects</a> these abnormalities.

It's an especially important assessment if you smoke, or have a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure (hypertension), cholesterol disorders, or diabetes. Vascular screening is a key <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-physical-examination/\">preventive</a> health tool, providing insight into your level of risk and whether a medical intervention is advisable. Screenings are performed by trained technologists under the supervision of vascular surgeons and cardiologists. They are painless.

Here are some common vascular screenings:

<strong>Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)</strong>

The ABI checks for signs of peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD can be painful if left untreated, and may cause problems with walking. Serious damage can lead to limb loss. During this test, your technician will take your blood pressure in both your limbs and your ankles. If your blood pressure is lower in your ankles than your arms, this may indicate lower body blockages in your arteries.

<strong>Carotid Artery Ultrasound</strong>

This test checks the arteries in your neck, which carry blood to the brain. During this safe and non-invasive screening, you lie flat on your back, and images of your carotid arteries are taken via ultrasound to determine the thickness of their walls. The thicker the walls, the greater your risk of heart disease. This assessment also checks how quickly and easily blood is flowing through the carotid arteries to determine whether there has been narrowing. If untreated, blocked arteries can lead to stroke.

<strong>Abdominal Ultrasound</strong>

An abdominal ultrasound checks for abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is a weak, bulging spot in the abdomen's largest artery . The aorta leads from the heart to the abdomen, and then branches into two smaller arteries in the legs. For this test, you will again lie on your back as measurements and images of the abdominal aorta are taken via ultrasound. An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs when the part of the aorta located in the abdomen swells and bursts, causing internal bleeding. About 75 percent of abdominal aortic aneurysm victims die before they reach the hospital.

<strong>How Often Should I Have Vascular Screening?</strong>

If your tests show no risks and your health is good, your doctor will likely recommend a screening every five years or so. If your physician wants to keep a closer eye on things, a yearly test may be prescribed. Cardiovascular diseases are often <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/heart-disease-symptoms/\">silent</a> until crisis hits, so preventive measures are crucial. Vascular screening detects cardiovascular damage, and also catches early warning signs sometimes missed by other testing methods. Early detection gives you a chance to adopt a <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/plant-based-diets-that-protect-your-heart\">healthier diet</a>, and commit to exercise, lifestyle and <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/stress-management/\">stress management techniques</a> that can help prevent further damage to your body.

5671,1,"2018-03-06 03:00:11","2018-03-06 03:00:11","In recent years, the <a href=\"https://celiac.org/live-gluten-free/glutenfreediet/food-options/\">gluten-free diet</a> has become more widely known and practiced. People with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes damage to the intestine when gluten is consumed, removed gluten from their diets out of necessity. Increasingly, however, a large group of people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity have followed suit, using <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/gluten-free-banana-bread/\">gluten-free recipes</a> and reporting better digestion and energy. But what is the difference between non-celiac gluten sensitivity and celiac disease?

<strong>What is Gluten?</strong>

Gluten is a composite of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, farro, spelt, triticale, kamut, and other wheat-derived grains like durum, semolina, and einkorn. Gluten is gluey, and helps foods like breads and pizza crusts maintain their shape and chewy texture. Gluten is found in baked goods, pastas, soups, cereals, salad dressings, cakes, pastries, condiments, and other foods. It’s often hidden in processed, packaged, and commercial foods where you’d least expect it. So-called “natural flavors,” sauces, and food colorings, for example, often hide ingredients containing gluten.

<strong>When is Gluten a Problem?</strong><strong> </strong>

Some argue that gluten isn’t an ideal food for anyone, as it’s difficult for the body to break down and digest. That said, gluten sensitivity, wheat allergies, and celiac disease are specific medical conditions that have impact systemic and gastrointestinal health. Is it possible to have non-celiac gluten issues? Yes. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a real concern. So what’s the difference, and how do you know which is which?

<strong>Celiac Disease (CD)</strong>

Celiac is a genetic autoimmune illness in which ingestion of gluten results in damage of gastrointestinal (GI) tissue. The body's response ultimately destroys and flattens the villi (villous atrophy) in the GI tract. This can lead to severe malabsorption of nutrients over time, resulting in poor health, inflammation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, low body weight, lack of developmental growth in children, and vulnerability to other illnesses, cancers, and infections. There are over 200 identified symptoms of celiac disease, including anemia, infertility, and behavioral changes. Dermatitis herpetiformis is celiac disease manifesting as a skin rash, and is common in those with the condition. There is no known cure for celiac disease beyond managing it with strict adherence to a <a href=\"https://www.glutenfreeliving.com/gluten-free-foods/diet/25-ways-to-eat-well-and-stay-healthy-on-the-gluten-free-diet/\">gluten-free diet</a>.

<strong>Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS)</strong>

Non-celiac gluten sensitivity may present with symptoms similar to celiac, but it doesn’t cause the autoimmune response of CD, or the anaphylactic reaction that wheat allergies do. Some researchers suspect that NCGS does involve an immune component, but this isn’t established. While tests and biomarkers exist for CD (and for wheat allergies), none conclusively indicate the presence of NCGS. Working with your doctor on an elimination diet can help distinguish non-celiac gluten sensitivity from other food intolerances.

<strong>Wheat Allergy</strong>

Wheat allergy is distinct from CD and NCGS. When someone has a <a href=\"http://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/wheat-gluten-allergy\">wheat allergy</a>, B-cells (a type of white blood cell) send out immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to “attack” the wheat, while other chemical messengers are released to alert the body to the invasion. This causes a rapid reaction that can result in itching, hives, swelling of the tongue, stomach pain, nausea, trouble breathing, or anaphylaxis — which is potentially life-threatening. Children sometimes outgrow a wheat allergy, but adults usually have it for life. It's managed with a strict wheat-free diet.

<strong>Diagnosis</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Celiac disease</strong> diagnosis involves blood tests to establish the presence of gluten antibodies, followed by a small intestinal biopsy to confirm villous atrophy. Patients must be on a diet containing gluten at the time of testing to get an accurate diagnosis.</li>
 	<li><strong>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity </strong>diagnosis is made through a blinded food challenge.</li>
 	<li><strong>Wheat allergy</strong> diagnosis is via skin prick test or IgE testing that looks for wheat allergy in the blood.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Thoughts Regarding a Gluten-Free Diet</strong>

If you have medical or personal reasons for going gluten free, keep in mind that when “gluten free” is listed on a food package, it doesn’t necessarily equate with healthier eating. The best way to ensure your health on a gluten free-diet is to adopt nutritious habits. If you can tolerate eating grains, opt for whole, <a href=\"http://www.gfco.org/\">certified (tested) gluten free</a> grains like brown rice, millet, and quinoa. Be sure to eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/dietary-fat/\">high quality fats</a> and proteins. Many packaged gluten-free foods are highly processed and contain refined starches, sugars, and industrialized oils, and those diagnosed with CD often fail to thrive after going gluten free when consuming these highly processed products. Choose your foods wisely to ensure optimal health, healing, and recovery for the long-term.

5676,1,"2018-03-05 02:00:19","2018-03-05 02:00:19","Colon cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United States. Roughly one in 20 people will be diagnosed with it during his or her lifetime. March is Colorectal Cancer <a href=\"https://www.ccalliance.org/awareness-month/\">Awareness Month</a>, making it the perfect time to discuss some of the ways to lower your risk.

Almost all colon cancer begins as precancerous polyps, or abnormal growths, in the rectum or colon. Polyps can also be benign, and may be present in the colon for years before cancer develops. Luckily, there are things you can do to lower your risk of developing colon cancer.

<strong>Colorectal cancer screenings </strong>can detect precancerous polyps for removal before they turn into cancer. Screenings also give you a better shot at detecting cancer early, when it’s easiest to treat. The American Cancer Society and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force both recommend screenings starting at age 50 for those within a normal risk range. Your doctor can help you determine if earlier screenings are appropriate based on your health history.

Most people know about colonoscopies, but it's important to note that there are also <em>non-invasive</em> screening methods. The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) evaluates blood found in the stool. If occult (hidden) blood is detected, further testing will be needed. But FIT testing itself requires no drug or dietary restrictions, and it's less physically taxing than other screening techniques.

<a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-exercise/\"><strong>Regular exercise</strong></a> is crucial to overall good health and a well-functioning immune system. Sedentary lifestyles are linked to increased risk of colorectal cancers. Research shows that active adults have a 40 to 50 percent reduced risk of developing colon cancer, and regular exercise may even reduce cancer risk in those who are obese or overweight.

<strong>Eat a nutritious diet </strong>rich in fiber, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Purchase organic produce whenever possible to avoid ingesting <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9498903\">carcinogenic pesticides</a>. Diets rich in veggies, fruits, and whole grains are linked to lowered colon cancer risk. Eat less red meat, and avoid processed meats like hot dogs, salami, and lunch meats, which have been tied to a higher colon cancer risk.

<strong>Avoid foods processed with sodium nitrite. </strong>Highly processed commercial meats like bacon, sausage, and lunch meats are usually preserved with sodium nitrite. Sodium nitrite converts to nitrosamine in the body, which is a known carcinogen. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2661797/\">The regular consumption of nitrites and processed meats have been linked with an increased risk for colon cancers</a> compared to those who avoid them.

<strong><a href=\"https://eheintl.com/quick_thought_smoking_cessation/\">Don’t smoke</a>. </strong>Long-term smokers have a higher risk of developing and dying from colorectal cancers than nonsmokers do. If you smoke and need help quitting, look into <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/quick_thought_smoking_cessation/\">smoking cessation</a> programs. You can also refer to the American Cancer Society’s <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/healthy/stay-away-from-tobacco/guide-quitting-smoking.html\"><em>Guide to Quitting Smoking</em></a><em>. </em>Getting help and support increases your chances of quitting successfully.

<strong>Limit or avoid alcohol. </strong>Colon cancer has been associated with heavy drinking. Recommended amounts are one drink per day for women, and no more than two per day for men. One drink equates to five ounces of wine, a twelve ounce beer, or 1 ½ ounces of 80 proof hard liquor.

Remember that a preventive lifestyle is key to boosting your health and longevity over time. Any adjustments you need to make are well worth your efforts, but if change feels overwhelming, take it step by step. Quitting smoking and committing to regular colorectal screenings are two of the most powerful things you can do to reduce your risks. Over time, you can adopt a healthier diet with reduced intake of red and processed meats. Identify the most pressing risk factors potentially impacting your health, and implement a strategy to tackle them one by one.

Despite that distinction, heart disease is still often regarded as more of a men's health issue. Even now, heart disease in women remains largely misunderstood. Women need to be aware of the risks, especially as <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/heart-disease-symptoms/\">heart disease symptoms</a> in women can be different from the classic signs among men.

The good news is that by eating a <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/mediterranean-quinoa-salad/\">heart-healthy diet</a>, getting <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/benefits-of-exercise/\">regular exercise</a>, and being more attuned to the symptoms and risks, women can do a great deal to protect themselves from the dangers of heart disease.

<strong>Heart Disease in Women: Know the Symptoms</strong>

While some women experience the dull, achy, or sharp chest pains associated with a <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/WarningSignsofaHeartAttack/Heart-Attack-Symptoms-in-Women_UCM_436448_Article.jsp#.WnfPqqinHIU\">heart attack</a>, others have no overt symptoms at all. Heart disease can be \"silent,\" going undiagnosed until a woman experiences a full-blown heart attack, heart failure, or stroke. Symptoms to monitor include:
<ul>
 	<li>Unusual, extreme fatigue</li>
 	<li>Sweating or cold sweats</li>
 	<li>Dizziness and lightheadedness</li>
 	<li>Shortness of breath</li>
 	<li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
 	<li>Pain in one or both arms</li>
 	<li>Shoulder, jaw, neck, upper back, or abdominal pain or discomfort</li>
</ul>
Heart disease in women can be subtle. Symptoms may be most acute during rest or sleep. Chest pain can seem like tightness or pressure, rather than the intense pains classically linked to cardiac arrest. Meanwhile, panic and anxiety attacks can mimic the signs of cardiac arrest, creating additional confusion. But these signs should always be treated seriously, especially if you don't have a history of such pain. If you think you may be experiencing a heart attack, seek medical attention right away.<strong> </strong>

<strong>Heart Disease in Women: Understand the Risk Factors</strong><strong> </strong>

While the traditional <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/gender-matters-heart-disease-risk-in-women\">risks for heart disease</a> — such as hypertension (high blood pressure), high cholesterol, and obesity — should always be noted, the following factors are important risk considerations for heart disease in women:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Smoking.</strong> While smoking is a risk factor for both men and women, it’s an especially significant threat to women’s heart health.</li>
 	<li><strong>Diabetes </strong>increases a woman’s chances of developing heart disease — even more so than it does for men.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pregnancy complications </strong>including high blood pressure can increase a woman’s chances of developing heart disease.</li>
 	<li><strong>Sedentary lifestyle </strong>and inactivity are major risk factors for heart disease.</li>
 	<li><strong>Menopause </strong>causes a drop in estrogen levels, upping the risk for coronary microvascular disease, or cardiovascular disease in the smaller blood vessels of the body.</li>
 	<li><strong>Excessive alcohol use </strong>poses a significant risk to heart health, as does a poor diet high in artificial trans <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/dietary-fat/\">fats</a>, and refined and highly processed foods.</li>
</ul>
Many women underestimate the potential risks of heart disease, and awareness is key--even for younger women. To reduce your chances of getting heart disease, make sure to:
<ul>
 	<li>Eat a healthy diet high in fiber, whole grains, natural foods, and fresh fruits and vegetables. Avoid artificial trans and hydrogenated fats, <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/sugar-effects/\">added and refined sugars</a>, and excess salt.</li>
 	<li>Exercise.</li>
 	<li>Maintain a healthy weight.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://eheintl.com/quick_thought_smoking_cessation/\">Quit smoking</a>.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://eheintl.com/stress-management/\">Lower stress</a> wherever possible, and find healthy ways of coping — like <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/how-to-meditate/\">meditation</a> and deep breathing exercises.</li>
 	<li>Limit your alcohol intake.</li>
 	<li>Keep your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar within a healthy range.</li>
</ul>
Remember that women don’t always present with the “classic” symptoms of heart disease. Protect yourself with a preventive approach to your health, and monitor any changes or symptoms you may be experiencing. If you notice any sudden shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting when you exert yourself, unusual body aches, or changes in your activity levels, check in with your doctor.

5683,1,"2018-02-20 04:00:44","2018-02-20 04:00:44","What is pharmacogenomics, and why should you know about it?

Pharmacogenomics examines a person’s <a href=\"https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-a-genome\">genome</a> and how a <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/modified_genes/\">genetic</a> predisposition might respond to various medications. Genes provide the blueprints for the body's proteins. Different drugs target different proteins, which help to transport, break down, and absorb the medication. By exploring how different drugs interact with different genetic profiles, doctors can more accurately assess which treatment plans are best for someone.

What works well for one person may be far less effective or even harmful for another. The aim of pharmacogenomics is to create highly targeted, <a href=\"http://genomemag.com/what-is-personalized-medicine/\">personalized medical care</a>, treating people's unique needs. With greater insight into someone’s genetic makeup, doctors can better select the medications and dosages for their patients.

<strong>Why Does Pharmacogenomics Matter?</strong>

Until recently, drugs were developed under the assumption that they work pretty much the same for everyone. But genetic research shows that an individualized approach to pharmaceutical treatment produces safer and more powerful results. Genomics also help to identify potential non-responders to medications, and can help prevent side effects and negative reactions to medication.

Pharmacogenomics mitigates the “trial-and-error” method of prescribing medications. It helps doctors find the best options faster, saving patients time, money, and potentially debilitating side effects.

<strong>What You Should Know</strong>

Pharmacogenomics is an exciting new development in medical care, but there are currently some challenges and limitations.
<ul>
 	<li>Drug responses are not usually determined by a single genetic variant.</li>
 	<li>There can be a broad number of intersecting environmental and genetic variants that influence how we respond to certain drugs.</li>
 	<li>Side effects are often the result of a patient not taking a medication as directed, or from doctors prescribing the wrong dosage.</li>
 	<li>Pharmacogenomics won’t necessarily reveal the perfect medication for you or your condition. It can narrow the choices, and help your doctor find the right medication faster, but it’s not a perfect predictor of successful treatment. It also won’t predict potential drug-to-drug or drug-to-supplement interactions.</li>
 	<li>Tests won’t show how you might respond to every medication. Current research focuses primarily on drugs for mental illnesses and depression, cardiovascular conditions, HIV, cancer, and pain management.</li>
 	<li>A particular genetic variant can up the likelihood of an adverse reaction to a drug, but doesn’t guarantee it.</li>

<strong>The Future of Pharmacogenomics</strong>

Pharmacogenomics shows a lot of promise in the field of personalized medical care, potentially making drug treatment plans safer and more effective. More studies are needed. Additional clinical trials would further identify the link between genes and treatment outcomes, and also confirm initial findings, thereby translating them into more precise prescribing guidelines.

Genome research can also help in the development of safer, better drugs with fewer side effects. Researchers now use genomic information to design drugs for subgroups of patients with specific genetic profiles, and also to search for drugs that target certain cellular and molecular pathways involved in disease processes. Despite some obstacles, pharmacogenomics shows promise as a powerful way to promote <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/precisionmedicine/definition\">precision medicine</a>, and may soon be part of routine medical care.

Throughout March, she'll be sharing her expertise on allergies and how to manage them. Here she discusses what you need to know about hives.</em>

Hives are a common skin rash — <a href=\"http://acaai.org/allergies/types/skin-allergies/hives-urticaria\">one person out of five</a> will experience them at some point. They can be triggered by a variety of substances or circumstances. Anything from pet dander to <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/peanut-allergy/\">peanuts</a> is a potential trigger for hives. As with any allergy, the most important thing is to recognize your personal triggers and avoid them as best as possible.

<em>1) hives typically last in one place for less than 24 hours, they are itchy, and they don’t bruise or scar. When you press on them, they blanch, meaning they turn white and then when you let go the blood comes back and the hive turns pink again.</em>

<em>Most other rashes stick around in one spot for days and don’t blanch. Rashes tends to spread locally, hives come and go in different areas of the body.</em>

<em>2) hives are caused when allergy cells get aggravated—-the most common causes—foods, medications, and infection. The allergy cells release a chemical called histamine, which causes swelling, itching, and redness.</em>

<em>3) people with allergies are slightly more prone to developing hives because they tend to have more allergy cells in the body. People with autoimmune conditions (when your body attacks your own organs) are also more prone to getting hives.</em>

<em>4) for people with bad hives, we sometimes recommend a low histamine diet! Believe it or not histamine is contained in a lot of foods. Every get an itchy mouth from eating pineapple? That’s because it’s high in histamine content!</em>
<em> Other foods to avoid—alcohol, aged cheese, processed meats, dried fruit</em>

<em>5) if you suffer from everyday hives, see an allergist to get to the root of the problem. Keep a log of food you eat, medicines you take, even over the counter and vitamins, and any recent infections you can think of or recent travel. We will need to do some detective work! Most of the time, we don’t uncover an underlying cause of hives, but the treatment is daily, non-sedating antihistamines.</em>

<em>6) if symptoms ever progress beyond the skin, such as difficulty breathing, swelling, feeling faint, or vomiting, that is a serious emergency and 911 needs to be called.</em>

Throughout March, she'll be sharing her expertise on allergies and how to manage them. Here she recommends how to handle different indoor and seasonal allergies.</em>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<em><strong>SEASONAL ALLERGIES: WHAT MIGHT I BE ALLERGIC TO?</strong></em>

<em>If you are experiencing symptoms in the early spring, tree pollen is the likely culprit. Late spring to summer is typically grass pollen, and weed pollen season begins in the late summer and can last up until the first frost. Interestingly, grass pollen counts tend to be highest the days after a thunderstorm. It is helpful to check daily pollen counts. On high pollen count days, staying inside might be the best bet.</em>

&nbsp;

<em><strong>WHAT TO DO ABOUT YOUR SEASONAL ALLERGIES</strong></em>

<em>Avoidance is key. During allergy season, keeping the windows closed and the air conditioning on while driving may be helpful. When coming inside after being outdoors, be sure to wash your clothing and hair to remove any of the pollen that may have been tracked inside. Do this before laying or sitting on furniture to prevent pollen transfer to the inside of you home. Pollens in particular are very difficult to control because of their prevalence in the environment.</em>

<em><strong>

</strong></em>

<em><strong>WHAT TO DO ABOUT INDOOR ALLERGIES</strong></em>

&nbsp;

<em><strong>MOLD: </strong>The key to indoor mold control is reducing humidity. This can be done by covering cold, moist surfaces such as water pipes with insulation, as well as increasing ventilation. A number of academic and federal agencies have developed guidelines for controlling mold in the home, and additional information can be found at the environmental protection agency website at www.epa.gov/mold. Visible mold should be removed from surfaces with detergent and water, and any areas where mold is imbedded should be removed or replaced.</em>

&nbsp;

<em><strong>PETS: </strong>If you have a dog or cat that causes symptoms, be sure to keep it out of the bedroom. It is important to note that even when cats are removed from a home, the allergen can still persist for up to 6 months. The use of HEPA filters is most effective <u>after</u> the pet is removed from the home, in conjunction with a thorough cleaning.</em>

&nbsp;

<em><strong>DUST MITES:</strong> Dust mites tend to thrive in humid environments and create nests in sofas, carpets, bedding, and any woven material. The humidity level in the room should be kept at a minimum. This can be accomplished by using an air conditioner in humid environments or simply opening the windows in dryer environments. Remove any humidifier machines from the bedroom. Dust proof covers on pillows and mattresses are helpful, and bedding should be washed weekly in hot water (140°F) and dried under high heat in an electric drier. If it is not feasible to remove carpets, they should be vacuumed and/or cleaned frequently. Wearing a mask while cleaning may be useful. The best benefit is seen when all of these avoidance measures are utilized.</em>

&nbsp;

<em><strong>COCKROACHES: </strong>Avoid keeping out open food containers or eating in the bedroom. Keep the bathroom dry and clean. Bait-traps are useful.</em>

&nbsp;

<em><strong>MICE: </strong> Mouse allergen is a recently recognized problem. The same principles apply as those for cockroach avoidance. Crawl spaces should be checked.</em>

At EHE, we believe knowing which small steps to take can lead to significantly better health. That's certainly true when it comes to allergies. All month long, I'll be sharing simple tips for preventing allergic reactions and mitigating symptoms. Allergies affect millions of Americans, and the pollen season beginning now can be particularly difficult. But with the right insight and actions, you can greatly reduce the impact an allergy has on your life.

<strong>Overview of Allergies</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>More than 50 million people in the United States suffer from allergies, making it the 6th-leading cause of chronic illness.</li>
 	<li>Among the most common allergic diseases: Asthma, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, and hives.</li>
 	<li>Allergic rhinitis (commonly called \"hay fever\") can be seasonal or perennial (year-round); symptoms typically include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, and itching or watery eyes. More than 20 million American adults and 6 million children experience allergic rhinitis.</li>
 	<li>Seasonal allergic rhinitis is usually caused by the immune system's overreaction to a trigger like pollen; perennial allergic rhinitis can result from sensitivity to substances such as pet dander or dust mites.</li>
 	<li>Recent research suggests approximately 4 percent of Americans have a <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/peanut-allergy/\">food allergy</a>, with the number rising in recent years. Food allergies are most common among children.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Common Allergy Symptoms</strong>

Allergies can present a range of symptoms. Seasonal allergies, food allergies, hives, and dermatitis are separate conditions with different symptoms. Seasonal allergies typically lead to sneezing, nasal inflammation, and irritated eyes. Rashes such as dermatitis and hives can indicate an allergic reaction to animal dander, household products, insect bites, or the ingestion of certain medications and foods. Nausea and/or vomiting can result from food allergies. And symptoms commonly associated with other illnesses can also be a sign of allergic reaction.

The important thing is to monitor symptoms like these and see if they recur. If they do not seem explainable by another illness, seek a consultation with an allergist.

<strong>What Can I Do About Allergies?</strong>

Allergies can be disruptive and, depending on their severity, dangerous. But there <em>are</em> simple ways to address them. If you know <em>what</em> triggers your allergic response and <em>how</em> to protect yourself from them, you can move in the right direction.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Know your triggers!</strong></li>
</ul>
The most important step to take is to identify your allergy or allergies. The substances that cause certain people to develop an allergic reaction are called allergens. To safeguard yourself against them, you have to know what they are! That means going to an allergist and getting a safe, convenient, and accurate allergy test. When you discuss your symptoms and history with a doctor, you'll be far likelier to (1) know whether you have an allergy, (2) recognize which allergens to avoid, and (3) receive medication, if recommended.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Nasal irrigation</strong></li>
</ul>
Pollen will get caught in your nose. The longer it's there, the more it will irritate your airways. That's why it's wise to keep the area clean, washing out pollen with a saline sinus rinse or nasal spray.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Close your windows</strong></li>
</ul>
This may seem obvious, but it's advisable to keep the windows to your home (and car) closed as much as possible to avoid contact with allergens. Pollen can be airborne, and it's much more difficult to control your indoor environment when you let in the outdoors.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Consider showering at night</strong></li>
</ul>
You could be inadvertently bringing a lot of pollen into bed with you if you don't wash your hair and body first. That means you'll be breathing in the allergen for hours. Clean up before hitting the hay, and you will reduce the chances of hay fever. (For the same reason, try to avoid wearing to bed any clothes that might have come into contact with pollen. Otherwise, your bedding becomes a triggering environment.)
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Wash your bedding weekly in hot water</strong></li>
</ul>
In a similar vein, laundering your sheets and pillowcases every week in water that's at least 140 degrees can eliminate most pollen and dust mites. Also dry using high heat rather than a clothesline, which exposes your clothes for long periods to the allergens you want to avoid.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>HEPA helps</strong></li>
</ul>
High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters trap many of the most common allergens (like pollen), thereby making them incredibly useful in preventing exposure to triggering substances. If your air conditioning does not come with HEPA, consider getting a portable air purifier with HEPA for the room or rooms where you spend a lot of time, especially your bedroom. Meanwhile, HEPA-equipped vacuums can help with dust mites and other non-airborne allergens. Change the filters every three months.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Keep things dry</strong></li>
</ul>
Humidity breeds mold, and mold spores can be terrible for allergies. That's why it's vital to keep moisture to a minimum, especially in bathrooms, kitchens, and basements, where water can seep into surfaces and create mold issues. You can measure your home's humidity with an inexpensive meter; try to keep it between 35% and 50%. Dehumidifiers and exhaust fans are useful when it comes to making the air drier. If you find mold, scrub thoroughly with bleach.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Avoid infestation</strong></li>
</ul>
You probably don't want mice, cockroaches, or other insects in your home as it is. But since unwelcome visitors can bring allergens with them, often spreading them in areas you don't immediately notice, it's critical to take measures if you suffer allergies.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Additional tips:</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Keep hydrated</strong> to help your nasal passages stay clear. <strong>Wear sunglasses</strong> to keep pollen out of your eyes. Make sure your <strong>pets are groomed and kept away</strong> from places where they're likely to leave dander, such as your bed. <strong>Check daily pollen counts</strong> so you can plan to be least exposed outside during times of highest pollen activity.

<ul>
 	<li>More than 50 million people in the United States suffer from allergies, making it the 6th-leading cause of chronic illness.</li>
 	<li>Among the most common allergic diseases: Asthma, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, and hives.</li>
 	<li>Allergic rhinitis (commonly called \"hay fever\") can be seasonal or perennial (year-round); symptoms typically include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, and itching or watery eyes. More than 20 million American adults and 6 million children experience allergic rhinitis.</li>

 	<li>Recent research suggests approximately 4 percent of Americans have a <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/peanut-allergy/\">food allergy</a>, with the number rising in recent years. Food allergies are most common among children.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Common Allergy Symptoms</strong>

Allergies can present a range of symptoms. Seasonal allergies, food allergies, hives, and dermatitis are separate conditions with different symptoms. Seasonal allergies typically lead to sneezing, nasal inflammation, and irritated eyes. Rashes such as dermatitis and hives can indicate an allergic reaction to animal dander, household products, insect bites, or the ingestion of certain medications and foods. Nausea and/or vomiting can result from food allergies. And symptoms commonly associated with other illnesses can also be a sign of allergic reaction.

The important thing is to monitor symptoms like these and see if they recur. If they do not seem explainable by another illness, seek a consultation with an allergist.

<strong>What Can I Do About Allergies?</strong>

Allergies can be disruptive and, depending on their severity, dangerous. But there <em>are</em> simple ways to address them. If you know <em>what</em> triggers your allergic response and <em>how</em> to protect yourself from them, you can move in the right direction.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Know your triggers!</strong></li>
</ul>
The most important step to take is to identify your allergy or allergies. The substances that cause certain people to develop an allergic reaction are called allergens. To safeguard yourself against them, you have to know what they are! That means going to an allergist and getting a safe, convenient, and accurate allergy test. When you discuss your symptoms and history with a doctor, you'll be far likelier to (1) know whether you have an allergy, (2) recognize which allergens to avoid, and (3) receive medication, if recommended.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Nasal irrigation</strong></li>
</ul>
Pollen will get caught in your nose. The longer it's there, the more it will irritate your airways. That's why it's wise to keep the area clean, washing out pollen with a saline sinus rinse or nasal spray.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Close your windows</strong></li>
</ul>
This may seem obvious, but it's advisable to keep the windows to your home (and car) closed as much as possible to avoid contact with allergens. Pollen can be airborne, and it's much more difficult to control your indoor environment when you let in the outdoors.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Consider showering at night</strong></li>
</ul>
You could be inadvertently bringing a lot of pollen into bed with you if you don't wash your hair and body first. That means you'll be breathing in the allergen for hours. Clean up before hitting the hay, and you will reduce the chances of hay fever. (For the same reason, try to avoid wearing to bed any clothes that might have come into contact with pollen. Otherwise, your bedding becomes a triggering environment.)
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Wash your bedding weekly in hot water</strong></li>
</ul>
In a similar vein, laundering your sheets and pillowcases every week in water that's at least 140 degrees can eliminate most pollen and dust mites. Also dry using high heat rather than a clothesline, which exposes your clothes for long periods to the allergens you want to avoid.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>HEPA helps</strong></li>
</ul>
High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters trap many of the most common allergens (like pollen), thereby making them incredibly useful in preventing exposure to triggering substances. If your air conditioning does not come with HEPA, consider getting a portable air purifier with HEPA for the room or rooms where you spend a lot of time, especially your bedroom. Meanwhile, HEPA-equipped vacuums can help with dust mites and other non-airborne allergens. Change the filters every three months.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Keep things dry</strong></li>
</ul>
Humidity breeds mold, and mold spores can be terrible for allergies. That's why it's vital to keep moisture to a minimum, especially in bathrooms, kitchens, and basements, where water can seep into surfaces and create mold issues. You can measure your home's humidity with an inexpensive meter; try to keep it between 35% and 50%. Dehumidifiers and exhaust fans are useful when it comes to making the air drier. If you find mold, scrub thoroughly with bleach.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Avoid infestation</strong></li>
</ul>
You probably don't want mice, cockroaches, or other insects in your home as it is. But since unwelcome visitors can bring allergens with them, often spreading them in areas you don't immediately notice, it's critical to take measures if you suffer allergies.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Additional tips:</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Keep hydrated</strong> to help your nasal passages stay clear. <strong>Wear sunglasses</strong> to keep pollen out of your eyes. Make sure your <strong>pets are groomed and kept away</strong> from places where they're likely to leave dander, such as your bed. <strong>Check daily pollen counts</strong> so you can plan to be least exposed outside during times of highest pollen activity.

Stay tuned for more allergy-related advice all month long!

<strong>EHE Health Coaching</strong>

An incredibly effective, convenient, and flexible service, especially for those patients with identified <em>health risks</em>. EHE has credentialed health coaches, educators, and nutritionists whose collective expertise covers virtually any identified health risk. Major focal points of coaching include physical activity, nutrition, weight management, stress management, prediabetes management, and smoking cessation.

Personal health coaches:
<ul>
 	<li>Work with patients for a <strong>full year</strong> after the EHE exam at <strong>no additional charge</strong> — it’s built into the program for anyone who wants it</li>
 	<li>Coach remotely by telephone, so it’s available no matter where the patient is</li>
</ul>
The initial session is called a “goals call,” during which the patient establishes what he or she wants to work on, identifies past challenges, current motivations, etc. Coaching can focus on one area or many areas — it’s entirely up to the patient. The entire process is patient-centric and designed to be encouraging, non-threatening, open, and flexible. Follow-up sessions are usually 15 to 20 minutes long and can be done on whatever schedule/frequency works best for the patient — weekly, biweekly, monthly, etc.

Pollen will get caught in your nose and airways. The longer it's there, the more it will irritate your respiratory system. That's why it's advisable to keep the area clean, washing out pollen with a saline sinus rinse or nasal spray.

<strong>Close your windows</strong>

This may seem obvious, but it's advisable to keep the windows to your home (and car) closed as much as possible to avoid contact with allergens. Pollen and other triggers can be airborne, and it's much more difficult to control your indoor environment when you let in the outdoors.

<strong>Consider showering at night</strong>

You could be inadvertently bringing a lot of pollen into bed with you if you don't wash your hair and body first. That means you'll be breathing in the allergen for hours. Clean up before hitting the hay, and you will reduce the chances of hay fever. (For the same reason, try to avoid wearing to bed any clothes that might have come into contact with pollen. Otherwise, your bedding becomes a triggering environment.)

<strong>Wash your bedding weekly in hot water</strong>

In a similar vein, laundering your sheets and pillowcases every week in water that's at least 140 degrees can eliminate most pollen and dust mites. Also dry using high heat rather than a clothesline, which exposes your clothes for long periods to the allergens you want to avoid.

<strong>HEPA helps</strong>

High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters trap many of the most common allergens (like pollen, pet dander, and dust mites), thereby making them incredibly useful in preventing exposure to triggering substances. If your air conditioning does not come with HEPA, consider getting a portable air purifier with HEPA for the room or rooms where you spend a lot of time, especially your bedroom. Change the filters every three months.

<strong>Keep things dry</strong>

Humidity breeds mold, and mold can be terrible for allergies. That's why it's vital to keep moisture to a minimum, especially in bathrooms, kitchens, and basements, where water can seep into surfaces and create mold issues. Dehumidifiers and fans are powerful tools when

<strong>Avoid infestation</strong>

You probably don't want mice, cockroaches, or other insects in your home as it is. But since unwelcome visitors can bring allergens with them, often spreading them in areas you don't immediately notice, it's critical to take measures if you suffer allergies.

<strong>Additional tips:</strong>

<strong>Keep hydrated</strong> to help your nasal passages stay clear. <strong>Wear sunglasses</strong> to keep pollen out of your eyes. Make sure your <strong>pets are groomed and kept away</strong> from places where they're likely to leave dander, such as your bed. <strong>Check daily pollen counts</strong> so you can plan to be least exposed outside during times of highest pollen activity.

At EHE, we believe knowing which small steps to take can lead to significantly better health.

But with the right insight and actions, you can greatly reduce the impact an allergy has on your life.

<strong>Overview of Allergies</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>More than 50 million people in the United States suffer from allergies, making it the 6th-leading cause of chronic illness.</li>
 	<li>Among the most common allergic diseases: Asthma, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, eczema, and hives.</li>
 	<li>Allergic rhinitis (commonly called \"hay fever\") can be seasonal or perennial (year-round); symptoms typically include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, and itching or watery eyes. More than 20 million American adults and 6 million children experience allergic rhinitis.</li>
 	<li>Seasonal allergic rhinitis is usually caused by the immune system's overreaction to a trigger like pollen or mold spores; perennial allergic rhinitis can result from sensitivity to substances such as pet dander or dust mites.</li>
 	<li>Recent research suggests approximately 4 percent of Americans have a <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/peanut-allergy/\">food allergy</a>, with the number rising in recent years. Food allergies are most common among children.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Common Allergy Symptoms</strong>

Allergies can present a range of symptoms. Seasonal allergies typically lead to sneezing, nasal inflammation, and irritated eyes. Rashes such as eczema, dermatitis, and hives can indicate an allergic reaction to animal dander, household products, insect bites, or the ingestion of certain medications and foods. Nausea and/or vomiting can result from food allergies. And symptoms commonly associated with other illnesses — including migraine headaches, fatigue, and fever — can also be a sign of allergic reaction.

The important thing is to monitor symptoms like these, see if they recur, and, if they do not seem explainable by another illness, seek a consultation with an allergist.

<strong>What Can I Do?</strong>

Allergies can be disruptive and, depending on their severity, dangerous. But there <em>are</em> simple ways to address them. If you know <em>what</em> triggers your allergic response and <em>how</em> to protect yourself from them, you can move in the right direction.

<strong>Know your triggers!</strong>

The most important step to take is to identify your allergy or allergies. The substances that cause certain people to develop an allergic reaction are called allergens. To safeguard yourself against them, you have to know what they are! That means going to an allergist and getting a safe, convenient, and accurate allergy test. When you discuss your symptoms and history with a doctor, you'll be far likelier to (1) know whether you have an allergy, (2) recognize which allergens to avoid, and (3) receive medication, if recommended.

<strong>Nasal irrigation</strong>

Humidity breeds mold, and mold spores can be terrible for allergies. That's why it's vital to keep moisture to a minimum, especially in bathrooms, kitchens, and basements, where water can seep into surfaces and create mold issues. You can measure your home's humidity with an inexpensive meter; try to keep it between 35% and 50%. Dehumidifiers and exhaust fans are useful when it comes to making the air drier. If you find mold, scrub thoroughly with bleach.

<strong>Avoid infestation</strong>

You probably don't want mice, cockroaches, or other insects in your home as it is. But since unwelcome visitors can bring allergens with them, often spreading them in areas you don't immediately notice, it's critical to take measures if you suffer allergies.

It promotes longevity, boosts cognitive function, and supports a vigorous immune system and overall wellbeing. Combined with a healthy diet, a lifelong commitment to exercise is one of the surest ways to stay healthy as you get older.

While some forms of exercise are doable at any age, modifications based on life stage are important. Your needs and abilities change over time, and while a good exercise regimen will benefit you no matter when you start, like any investment, the sooner the better. Here are some tips in order to enjoy the benefits of regular exercise at any age.

<strong>Exercise for Children and Teens</strong>

Childhood is the perfect time to encourage play and an active lifestyle, building the foundation for good lifelong habits. <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/exercise.html\">Kids who are physically active</a> have stronger muscles and bones, leaner bodies, decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and other chronic conditions, and better confidence and mental health. Young children and teens have a variety of fitness options available to them, such as dance, swimming, martial arts, school sports, and outdoor games. Fitness guidelines for children and teens recommend:
<ul>
 	<li>Keeping periods of inactivity (besides sleeping) to under two hours at a time</li>
 	<li>Vigorous activity for a minimum of one hour per day</li>
</ul>
<strong>Exercise During Your 20s</strong>

This is the perfect time to establish a daily fitness and nutrition routine, especially post-college. If you have good fitness habits in place, continue with those sports and activities you already love doing. This is the decade to emphasize cardiovascular fitness, which supports your long-term health as you get older. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate cardio exercise five days per week, or 25 minutes of intense cardio three days per week.

<strong>Exercise During Your 30s</strong>

This is the decade to emphasize core strength, especially if you plan to get pregnant, and add <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/interval-training/art-20044588\">interval training</a> to your cardio routine to counteract a slowing metabolism. This is also the time to shore up and maintain your muscle mass, as most people lose muscle as they age. Weight training, weight-bearing yoga postures, Pilates, and anything that works to strengthen and build your muscles is a must.

<strong>Exercise During Your 40s</strong>

If you are already in great shape, this is an excellent time to increase your activity and take your fitness up a notch. The more exercise the better — this will protect your muscle mass, as well as your telomeres, which are stretches of DNA that promote longevity and cellular health. Alternate between moderate and vigorous cardiovascular exercise, and continue weight training. Bike, take long, brisk walks, hike, or take a fun new fitness class. The key is to keep moving, and stay active. If you are new to the fitness game, jump in - your body will respond beautifully, and you will feel and look better than ever.

<strong>Exercise During Your 50s</strong>

Lowered estrogen and fluctuating hormone levels due to menopause can lead to mood dysregulation and potential bone loss. Exercise is excellent for stabilizing moods, and weight-bearing exercises are vital to maintaining muscle and bone mass. Aim for 30 minutes of daily weight-bearing exercise, such as yoga, dancing, tennis, jogging, or weight training. This is also the decade to focus on protecting leg and lower body strength. Research shows a connection between <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/health-34764693\">leg strength and brain health</a> as we age. The mechanism isn’t fully understood, but one theory posits that brain-stimulating neurochemicals are released when muscles are worked, and leg muscles are some of the largest in the body. Regardless, physical exercise that improves brain health is doubly important to pursue.

<strong>Exercise During Your 60s and Beyond</strong>

The healthier and more fit you’ve been up to this point, the better. Make adjustments as your body requires — don’t ignore illness, pains, or signs of distress. But there is no need to slow down if you still feel good. Keep moving and stay active. The better shape you're in, the greater your vitality as you age. While weight gain is common after menopause, it's still possible to drop extra pounds and trim your belly at this life stage. It's also important to sustain excellent cardiovascular health, and to reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes and various cancers. Light aerobic activity, regular brisk walks, and gardening are all great options to keep moving. <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/dumbbell-strength-training-for-seniors-3498669\">Strength training</a> continues to be important in these years, so try to do a full body workout with medium weights for about 40 minutes twice a week in addition to cardio activities.

Young children and teens have a variety of fitness options available to them, such as dance, swimming, martial arts, school sports, and outdoor games. Fitness guidelines for children and teens recommend:
<ul>
 	<li>Keeping periods of inactivity (besides sleeping) to under two hours at a time</li>
 	<li>Vigorous activity for a minimum of one hour per day</li>
</ul>
<strong>Exercise During Your 20s</strong>

This is the perfect time to establish a daily fitness and nutrition routine, especially post-college. If you have good fitness habits in place, continue with those sports and activities you already love doing. This is the decade to emphasize cardiovascular fitness, which supports your long-term health as you get older. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate cardio exercise five days per week, or 25 minutes of intense cardio three days per week.

<strong>Exercise During Your 30s</strong>

This is the decade to emphasize core strength, especially if you plan to get pregnant, and add <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/interval-training/art-20044588\">interval training</a> to your cardio routine to counteract a slowing metabolism. This is also the time to shore up and maintain your muscle mass, as most people lose muscle as they age. Weight training, weight-bearing yoga postures, Pilates, and anything that works to strengthen and build your muscles is a must.

<strong>Exercise During Your 40s</strong>

If you are already in great shape, this is an excellent time to increase your activity and take your fitness up a notch. The more exercise the better — this will protect your muscle mass, as well as your telomeres, which are stretches of DNA that promote longevity and cellular health. Alternate between moderate and vigorous cardiovascular exercise, and continue weight training. Bike, take long, brisk walks, hike, or take a fun new fitness class. The key is to keep moving, and stay active. If you are new to the fitness game, jump in - your body will respond beautifully, and you will feel and look better than ever.

<strong>Exercise During Your 50s</strong>

Lowered estrogen and fluctuating hormone levels due to menopause can lead to mood dysregulation and potential bone loss. Exercise is excellent for stabilizing moods, and weight-bearing exercises are vital to maintaining muscle and bone mass. Aim for 30 minutes of daily weight-bearing exercise, such as yoga, dancing, tennis, jogging, or weight training. This is also the decade to focus on protecting leg and lower body strength. Research shows a connection between <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/health-34764693\">leg strength and brain health</a> as we age. The mechanism isn’t fully understood, but one theory posits that brain-stimulating neurochemicals are released when muscles are worked, and leg muscles are some of the largest in the body. Regardless, physical exercise that improves brain health is doubly important to pursue.

<strong>Exercise During Your 60s and Beyond</strong>

The healthier and more fit you’ve been up to this point, the better. Make adjustments as your body requires — don’t ignore illness, pains, or signs of distress. But there is no need to slow down if you still feel good. Keep moving and stay active. The better shape you're in, the greater your vitality as you age. While weight gain is common after menopause, it's still possible to drop extra pounds and trim your belly at this life stage. It's also important to sustain excellent cardiovascular health, and to reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes and various cancers. Light aerobic activity, regular brisk walks, and gardening are all great options to keep moving. <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/dumbbell-strength-training-for-seniors-3498669\">Strength training</a> continues to be important in these years, so try to do a full body workout with medium weights for about 40 minutes twice a week in addition to cardio activities.

At EHE, we believe knowing which small steps to take can lead to significantly better health. That's certainly true when it comes to allergies. All month long, I'll be sharing simple tips for preventing allergic reactions and mitigating symptoms. Allergies affect millions of Americans, and the pollen season beginning now can be particularly difficult. But with the right insight and actions, you can greatly reduce the impact an allergy has on your life.

<strong>Overview of Allergies</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>More than 50 million people in the United States suffer from allergies, making it the 6th-leading cause of chronic illness.</li>
 	<li>Among the most common allergic diseases: Asthma, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, and hives.</li>
 	<li>Allergic rhinitis (commonly called \"hay fever\") can be seasonal or perennial (year-round); symptoms typically include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, and itching or watery eyes. More than 20 million American adults and 6 million children experience allergic rhinitis.</li>
 	<li>Seasonal allergic rhinitis is usually caused by the immune system's overreaction to a trigger like pollen; perennial allergic rhinitis can result from sensitivity to substances such as pet dander or dust mites.</li>
 	<li>Recent research suggests approximately 4 percent of Americans have a <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/peanut-allergy/\">food allergy</a>, with the number rising in recent years. Food allergies are most common among children.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Common Allergy Symptoms</strong>

Allergies can present a range of symptoms. Seasonal allergies, food allergies, hives, and dermatitis are separate conditions with different symptoms. Seasonal allergies typically lead to sneezing, nasal inflammation, and irritated eyes. Rashes such as dermatitis and hives can indicate an allergic reaction to animal dander, household products, insect bites, or the ingestion of certain medications and foods. Nausea and/or vomiting can result from food allergies. And symptoms commonly associated with other illnesses can also be a sign of allergic reaction.

The important thing is to monitor symptoms like these and see if they recur. If they do not seem explainable by another illness, seek a consultation with an allergist.

<strong>What Can I Do About Allergies?</strong>

Allergies can be disruptive and, depending on their severity, dangerous. But there <em>are</em> simple ways to address them. If you know <em>what</em> triggers your allergic response and <em>how</em> to protect yourself from them, you can move in the right direction.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Know your triggers!</strong></li>
</ul>
The most important step to take is to identify your allergy or allergies. The substances that cause certain people to develop an allergic reaction are called allergens. To safeguard yourself against them, you have to know what they are! That means going to an allergist and getting a safe, convenient, and accurate allergy test. When you discuss your symptoms and history with a doctor, you'll be far likelier to (1) know whether you have an allergy, (2) recognize which allergens to avoid, and (3) receive medication, if recommended.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Nasal irrigation</strong></li>
</ul>
Pollen will get caught in your nose. The longer it's there, the more it will irritate your airways. That's why it's wise to keep the area clean, washing out pollen with a saline sinus rinse or nasal spray.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Close your windows</strong></li>
</ul>
This may seem obvious, but it's advisable to keep the windows to your home (and car) closed as much as possible to avoid contact with allergens. Pollen can be airborne, and it's much more difficult to control your indoor environment when you let in the outdoors.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Consider showering at night</strong></li>
</ul>
You could be inadvertently bringing a lot of pollen into bed with you if you don't wash your hair and body first. That means you'll be breathing in the allergen for hours. Clean up before hitting the hay, and you will reduce the chances of hay fever. (For the same reason, try to avoid wearing to bed any clothes that might have come into contact with pollen. Otherwise, your bedding becomes a triggering environment.)
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Wash your bedding weekly in hot water</strong></li>
</ul>
In a similar vein, laundering your sheets and pillowcases every week in water that's at least 140 degrees can eliminate most pollen and dust mites. Also dry using high heat rather than a clothesline, which exposes your clothes for long periods to the allergens you want to avoid.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>HEPA helps</strong></li>
</ul>
High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters trap many of the most common allergens (like pollen), thereby making them incredibly useful in preventing exposure to triggering substances. If your air conditioning does not come with HEPA, consider getting a portable air purifier with HEPA for the room or rooms where you spend a lot of time, especially your bedroom. Meanwhile, HEPA-equipped vacuums can help with dust mites and other non-airborne allergens. Change the filters every three months.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Keep things dry</strong></li>
</ul>
Humidity breeds mold, and mold spores can be terrible for allergies. That's why it's vital to keep moisture to a minimum, especially in bathrooms, kitchens, and basements, where water can seep into surfaces and create mold issues. You can measure your home's humidity with an inexpensive meter; try to keep it between 35% and 50%. Dehumidifiers and exhaust fans are useful when it comes to making the air drier. If you find mold, scrub thoroughly with bleach.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Avoid infestation</strong></li>
</ul>
You probably don't want mice, cockroaches, or other insects in your home as it is. But since unwelcome visitors can bring allergens with them, often spreading them in areas you don't immediately notice, it's critical to take measures if you suffer allergies.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Additional tips:</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Keep hydrated</strong> to help your nasal passages stay clear. <strong>Wear sunglasses</strong> to keep pollen out of your eyes. Make sure your <strong>pets are groomed and kept away</strong> from places where they're likely to leave dander, such as your bed. <strong>Check daily pollen counts</strong> so you can plan to be least exposed outside during times of highest pollen activity.

Stay tuned for more allergy-related advice all month long!

People with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes damage to the intestine when gluten is consumed, removed gluten from their diets out of necessity. Increasingly, however, a large group of people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity have followed suit, using <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/gluten-free-banana-bread/\">gluten-free recipes</a> and reporting better digestion and energy. But what is the difference between non-celiac gluten sensitivity and celiac disease?

<strong>What is Gluten?</strong>

Gluten is a composite of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, farro, spelt, triticale, kamut, and other wheat-derived grains like durum, semolina, and einkorn. Gluten is gluey, and helps foods like breads and pizza crusts maintain their shape and chewy texture. Gluten is found in baked goods, pastas, soups, cereals, salad dressings, cakes, pastries, condiments, and other foods. It’s often hidden in processed, packaged, and commercial foods where you’d least expect it. So-called “natural flavors,” sauces, and food colorings, for example, often hide ingredients containing gluten.

<strong>When is Gluten a Problem?</strong><strong> </strong>

Some argue that gluten isn’t an ideal food for anyone, as it’s difficult for the body to break down and digest. That said, gluten sensitivity, wheat allergies, and celiac disease are specific medical conditions that have impact systemic and gastrointestinal health. Is it possible to have non-celiac gluten issues? Yes. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a real concern. So what’s the difference, and how do you know which is which?

<strong>Celiac Disease (CD)</strong>

Celiac is a genetic autoimmune illness in which ingestion of gluten results in damage of gastrointestinal (GI) tissue. The body's response ultimately destroys and flattens the villi (villous atrophy) in the GI tract. This can lead to severe malabsorption of nutrients over time, resulting in poor health, inflammation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, low body weight, lack of developmental growth in children, and vulnerability to other illnesses, cancers, and infections. There are over 200 identified symptoms of celiac disease, including anemia, infertility, and behavioral changes. Dermatitis herpetiformis is celiac disease manifesting as a skin rash, and is common in those with the condition. There is no known cure for celiac disease beyond managing it with strict adherence to a <a href=\"https://www.glutenfreeliving.com/gluten-free-foods/diet/25-ways-to-eat-well-and-stay-healthy-on-the-gluten-free-diet/\">gluten-free diet</a>.

<strong>Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS)</strong>

Non-celiac gluten sensitivity may present with symptoms similar to celiac, but it doesn’t cause the autoimmune response of CD, or the anaphylactic reaction that wheat allergies do. Some researchers suspect that NCGS does involve an immune component, but this isn’t established. While tests and biomarkers exist for CD (and for wheat allergies), none conclusively indicate the presence of NCGS. Working with your doctor on an elimination diet can help distinguish non-celiac gluten sensitivity from other food intolerances.

<strong>Wheat Allergy</strong>

Wheat allergy is distinct from CD and NCGS. When someone has a <a href=\"http://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/wheat-gluten-allergy\">wheat allergy</a>, B-cells (a type of white blood cell) send out immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to “attack” the wheat, while other chemical messengers are released to alert the body to the invasion. This causes a rapid reaction that can result in itching, hives, swelling of the tongue, stomach pain, nausea, trouble breathing, or anaphylaxis — which is potentially life-threatening. Children sometimes outgrow a wheat allergy, but adults usually have it for life. It's managed with a strict wheat-free diet.

<strong>Diagnosis</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Celiac disease</strong> diagnosis involves blood tests to establish the presence of gluten antibodies, followed by a small intestinal biopsy to confirm villous atrophy. Patients must be on a diet containing gluten at the time of testing to get an accurate diagnosis.</li>
 	<li><strong>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity </strong>diagnosis is made through a blinded food challenge.</li>
 	<li><strong>Wheat allergy</strong> diagnosis is via skin prick test or IgE testing that</li>
</ul>
<strong>Thoughts Regarding a Gluten-Free Diet</strong>

If you have medical or personal reasons for going gluten free, keep in mind that when “gluten free” is listed on a food package, it doesn’t necessarily equate with healthier eating. The best way to ensure your health on a gluten free-diet is to adopt nutritious habits. If you can tolerate eating grains, opt for whole, <a href=\"http://www.gfco.org/\">certified (tested) gluten free</a> grains like brown rice, millet, and quinoa. Be sure to eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/dietary-fat/\">high quality fats</a> and proteins. Many packaged gluten-free foods are highly processed and contain refined starches, sugars, and industrialized oils, and those diagnosed with CD often fail to thrive after going gluten free when consuming these highly processed products. Choose your foods wisely to ensure optimal health, healing, and recovery for the long-term.

The body's response ultimately destroys and flattens the villi (villous atrophy) in the GI tract. This can lead to severe malabsorption of nutrients over time, resulting in poor health, inflammation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, low body weight, lack of developmental growth in children, and vulnerability to other illnesses, cancers, and infections. There are over 200 identified symptoms of celiac disease, including anemia, infertility, and behavioral changes. Dermatitis herpetiformis is celiac disease manifesting as a skin rash, and is common in those with the condition. There is no known cure for celiac disease beyond managing it with strict adherence to a <a href=\"https://www.glutenfreeliving.com/gluten-free-foods/diet/25-ways-to-eat-well-and-stay-healthy-on-the-gluten-free-diet/\">gluten-free diet</a>.

<strong>Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS)</strong>

Non-celiac gluten sensitivity may present with symptoms similar to celiac, but it doesn’t cause the autoimmune response of CD, or the anaphylactic reaction that wheat allergies do. Some researchers suspect that NCGS does involve an immune component, but this isn’t established. While tests and biomarkers exist for CD (and for wheat allergies), none conclusively indicate the presence of NCGS. Working with your doctor on an elimination diet can help distinguish non-celiac gluten sensitivity from other food intolerances.

<strong>Wheat Allergy</strong>

Wheat allergy is distinct from CD and NCGS. When someone has a <a href=\"http://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/wheat-gluten-allergy\">wheat allergy</a>, B-cells (a type of white blood cell) send out immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to “attack” the wheat, while other chemical messengers are released to alert the body to the invasion. This causes a rapid reaction that can result in itching, hives, swelling of the tongue, stomach pain, nausea, trouble breathing, or anaphylaxis — which is potentially life-threatening. Children sometimes outgrow a wheat allergy, but adults usually have it for life. It's managed with a strict wheat-free diet.

<strong>Diagnosis</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Celiac disease</strong> diagnosis involves blood tests to establish the presence of gluten antibodies, followed by a small intestinal biopsy to confirm villous atrophy. Patients must be on a diet containing gluten at the time of testing to get an accurate diagnosis.</li>
 	<li><strong>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity </strong>diagnosis is made through a blinded food challenge.</li>
 	<li><strong>Wheat allergy</strong> diagnosis is via skin prick test or IgE testing that looks for wheat allergy in the blood.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Thoughts Regarding a Gluten-Free Diet</strong>

If you have medical or personal reasons for going gluten free, keep in mind that when “gluten free” is listed on a food package, it doesn’t necessarily equate with healthier eating. The best way to ensure your health on a gluten free-diet is to adopt nutritious habits. If you can tolerate eating grains, opt for whole, <a href=\"http://www.gfco.org/\">certified (tested) gluten free</a> grains like brown rice, millet, and quinoa. Be sure to eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as <a href=\"https://eheintl.com/dietary-fat/\">high quality fats</a> and proteins. Many packaged gluten-free foods are highly processed and contain refined starches, sugars, and industrialized oils, and those diagnosed with CD often fail to thrive after going gluten free when consuming these highly processed products. Choose your foods wisely to ensure optimal health, healing, and recovery for the long-term.

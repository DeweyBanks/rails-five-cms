1,"Is-Dark-Chocolate-HealthySee-How-It-C","Is Dark Chocolate Healthy? See How It Can Be!","<p>Is dark chocolate healthy? While we wouldn&#39;t exactly call it a superfood, dark chocolate does have some remarkable health benefits, making it a good choice for dessert. It is loaded with <a href=""https://eheintl.com/the_13_essential_vitamins/"">vitamins</a>, <a href=""https://eheintl.com/anti-aging-foods/"">flavonols</a>, and antioxidants, and as we outline below, dark chocolate has plenty of other advantages. Just to be clear: We&#39;re not talking about the processed, sugar-laden candy bars you&#39;ll find in the supermarket checkout aisle. We mean high-quality dark chocolate with at least 60 percent cocoa content. What makes dark chocolate healthy? Check out some of its benefits:</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href=""http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/dark-chocolate-serotonin-levels-5558.html""><strong>Dark chocolate is a mood-booster</strong></a>. Dark chocolate is full of compounds that can help prevent <a href=""https://eheintl.com/types-of-depression/"">depression</a>, such as anandamide, which is structurally similar to THC but much milder. Anandamide can give you a good mood and energy lift, without the potential health concerns that come with other stimulating substances. Chocolate also contains phenylethylamine, which converts to mood lifting and stabilizing serotonin in the body.</li>
	<li><a href=""https://www.prevention.com/food/healthy-eating-tips/dark-chocolate-and-antioxidants-0""><strong>Dark chocolate is loaded with antioxidants</strong></a>, and provides excellent free-radical protection. There are more polyphenols and flavonoids present in dark chocolate than in either tea or wine. These help neutralize free radicals, and shield the body from their potential damage.</li>
	<li><a href=""https://www.aarp.org/health/medical-research/info-03-2011/dark-chocolate-can-help-lower-your-blood-pressure.html""><strong>Dark chocolate can lower blood pressure</strong></a>. The flavonols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium (the lining of arteries) to produce nitric oxide, which then signals the arteries to relax. This lowers resistance to blood flow, thereby lowering blood pressure.</li>
	<li><a href=""https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/can-chocolate-be-good-for-you.html""><strong>Dark chocolate may help prevent cancer</strong></a>. The rich supply of flavonoids in dark chocolate may account for its potential cancer-fighting properties. While studies are still emerging, they suggest that chocolate&rsquo;s antioxidant properties possibly protect against free radical cellular damage that leads to cancer formation.</li>
	<li><strong>Flavonols favorably impact heart health</strong>. Eating flavonoid-rich dark chocolate is good for your heart. A study published in the <em>International Journal of Cardiology</em> reports that dark chocolate intake considerably improved heart circulation in healthy adults. The compounds in dark chocolate are also significantly protective against the oxidation of LDL, which causes less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries over time.</li>
	<li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16702322""><strong>Dark chocolate may protect your skin against the sun</strong></a>. Flavonols can protect against sun damage, and also improve blood flow to the skin.</li>
	<li><strong>Dark chocolate is amazing brain food</strong>. One study showed that five days of high-flavonol dark cocoa consumption improved blood flow to the brain in healthy volunteers. Another study reports that dark chocolate consumption improved cognitive and verbal function in elderly adults with mental impairment.</li>
</ol>

<p>While fresh fruit, vegetables, and tea are known as fantastic sources of antioxidants (and you should <em>definitely</em> consume lots of them), research shows that the cocoa bean is an even more potent source. It features one of the highest concentrations of nutrients and antioxidants of any food. That makes dark chocolate healthy, as long as you enjoy it in moderation. Your best bet is to buy 100 percent cocoa or raw cacao powder, and add it to your smoothies, whole grain cereals, or low-sugar homemade dishes. If you go with bars that are at least 60 to 70 percent cocoa, one to three squares per day is all you need to enjoy the benefits.&nbsp;</p>

3,"This-Fantastic-Protein-Shake-Will-Ene","This Fantastic Protein Shake Will Energize You","Your standard protein shake can be chalky, flavorless, and the <i>last</i> thing you feel like drinking... no matter <em>how</em> good it may be for you.

That's why we've created an energizing protein shake that is not just nutritious, but also delicious. Adding espresso to the mix makes this protein shake the perfect morning or pre-workout drink to boost your energy and get you vital nutrients.

As we've emphasized in the past, caffeine is <a href=""https://eheintl.com/energy_drinks_and_their_ingredients/"">no substitute</a> for the energy you get from a healthy lifestyle. But moderate consumption of espresso can <a href=""https://www.caffeineinformer.com/top-10-caffeine-health-benefits"">benefit your health</a> in a number of ways. It's been shown to improve long-term memory, maintain dopamine levels, and facilitate focus.

We recommend drinking the shake about one hour before exercising. Just remember: You can have too much of a good thing, and consuming excessive caffeine can lead to anxiety, sleeplessness, and other negative consequences. Try not to exceed two cups per day.

The more important component in this shake is the protein. Getting enough protein can be challenging during busy days, especially since most people rely on animal protein, which can involve a lot more preparation. By adding organic protein powder to a morning or afternoon meal, you'll increase satiety and help ensure that your body gets what it needs.

Specifically, our body needs protein to produce hormones, repair tissues, and maintain healthy bones and metabolic function. We recommend choosing an organic variety sourced from pea, grass-fed whey, hemp, or brown rice. Watch for <a href=""https://eheintl.com/naturally_occurring_sugars_versus_added_sugars/"">added sugars</a> and other ingredients you don't recognize.

Chia literally means ""strength,"" and was used as an energy booster in ancient Aztec society. Adding chia seeds to this smoothie is the perfect way to boost its nutrient content. Chia seeds expand and form a gel-like substance in the stomach, helping to satiate and prevent overeating. They also have a concentration of omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and <a href=""https://eheintl.com/digestive_health_fiber/"">fiber</a>.

5,"You-Can-Make-This-Recipe-to-Get-Amazi","You Can Make This Recipe to Get Amazing Matcha Tea Benefits","Matcha tea benefits your health in a variety of ways. Since you consume the green tea leaf whole when using matcha, all of the tea's antioxidant levels are multiplied. Antioxidants help fight inflammation, protect against <a href=""https://eheintl.com/sun-damaged-skin/"">ultraviolet (UV) exposure</a> and heal existing damage, <a href=""https://eheintl.com/anti-aging-foods/"">slows premature aging</a>, and boost energy. According to oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), matcha ranks highest in the number of antioxidants, boasting five times the level of other plant-based foods. Matcha is also a great substitute for coffee, since the antioxidant levels help slow the absorption of caffeine into our system. Many people notice steady energy and intense focus when they drink matcha, as opposed to the high and subsequent crash they may experience with other caffeine sources.

Our matcha latte recipe harnesses these great matcha tea benefits. We’ve included collagen powder to add even more healing powers to the matcha base. Collagen powder helps heal our intestinal lining, has been shown to decrease wrinkles and cellulite, and improves joint pain. About  70 percent of our skin is collagen, which is what <a href=""https://eheintl.com/best-foods-for-skin/"">gives our skin</a> its natural elasticity. Since our collagen production naturally decreases as we age, increasing our consumption of vitamin C (which helps manufacture collagen) and supplements can help keep our skin smooth and glowing. Matcha tea benefits are <a href=""http://www.health.com/nutrition/what-is-matcha"">plentiful</a>, and this latte is a delicious delivery system!

6,"How-to-Be-Great-at-Meal-Prep-Sunday","How to Be Great at Meal Prep Sunday","Meal Prep Sunday is just what it sounds like: planning and preparing a series of meals all at once. It's not a new idea, but it's recently become a fixation among people who seek good nutrition despite tight budgets and busy schedules. Not only is it an efficient (and cost-effective!) way to cook, but it lends itself to <a href=""https://eheintl.com/healthyeating/"">healthy eating</a>.

Food ""prep"" can mean a variety of things — from fully preparing each meal so it's ready to eat, to simply washing and chopping ingredients in order to streamline the cooking process. The ultimate goal on Meal Prep Sunday is to invest effort early to ensure <a href=""https://eheintl.com/mindful-eating/"">thoughtful, healthy eating</a> later. When you prepare food <a href=""http://www.eatthis.com/meal-prep-sunday/"">for the week ahead</a>, it's easier to preserve good eating habits even after the chaos of the week begins.

We have a few general guidelines for becoming a Meal Prep Sunday master, as well as an incredibly easy and delicious mini frittata recipe for healthy grab-and-go breakfasts you can make ahead of a week's worth of hectic mornings. Enjoy!

<strong>Tip #1: The Slow Cooker Is Your Meal Prep Sunday Friend</strong>

The slow cooker is the absolute perfect tool for food prep and easy dinners throughout the week. There are a few ways you can use it. The first is to find one recipe you love (like a soup or chili), press start on Sunday, and by Monday morning you'll have five lunches magically ready to go. If you don't need a ton of variety over the course of your week, this is a great way to get all of your lunches done at once.

If variety <em>is</em> important, we recommend creating ""slow cooker packs"" for dinner. Each Sunday, choose three to five slow cooker recipes that sound good to you. Simply put all of the ingredients into large freezer bags, mark the meal and the date you want it, and store in the fridge. Each morning, simply grab a bag, pour it into the slow cooker, and press start. By the time you're home from work, dinner is served! The great thing with these meal packs is that you can make a dozen or more at a time.

<strong>Tip #2: Make One-Pan Dinners Happen</strong>

If your cooking style is more spontaneous, there's no need to make full meals all at once. Simply cleaning and chopping your herbs, vegetables, and fruits can make the week ahead a breeze. Cleaning meat and prepping your seasoning ahead of time only add to the convenience. We also recommend cooking grains like quinoa and rice, or steaming starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes, in large quantities before the week begins.

One-pan dinners are the perfect way to utilize this type of prep. Since veggies will already be chopped and meats already marinated, simply spread them on a sheet pan with avocado or olive oil, and bake at 400 degrees for 20-30 minutes, depending on the specific ingredients you're using. Because your grains will already be cooked as well, simply scoop a portion onto everyone's plate and heat. <em>Voila!</em> Another option is to create ""stir fry bags"" out of your chopped veggies and meats. Just pour them into a wok for a quick, no-mess dinner.

<strong>Tip #3: Try to Get Your Vegetables at Lunch</strong>

Creating a week's worth of salads each Sunday is an excellent way to integrate a larger (and more diverse) set of vegetables and fruits into your diet. Every plant comes with its own unique composition of micronutrients; ""eating the rainbow"" throughout the week will help you cover your nutrient bases. Choose 6-12 varieties each week (or more!). On Sunday, pick a few varieties for each salad container and build interesting combinations as your base. Next, top each container with a different fat, like raw nuts or avocado. Last, choose a protein like chickpeas, quinoa, chicken, or hard boiled eggs to make your salads satiating. Half of a lemon and a tablespoon of olive oil is the perfect dressing. You can keep oil at work, or bring in mini containers to dress right before you eat so your salad doesn't get soggy.

<strong>Tip #4: Meal Prep Sunday Supercharges Breakfast  </strong>

We've all heard it before: Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. But you may find it is also the most challenging meal to find time to prepare, given how rushed we tend to be before work or school. We recommend getting 15-20 grams of protein within two hours of waking up to kick start your metabolism. One favorite Meal Prep Sunday option for breakfast is a smoothie pack. For smoothie packs, combine greens, fruit, and booster foods like chia or flax seeds in bags; then, store them in the freezer. Each morning, simply pour the contents into a blender with protein powder and your preferred liquid. Breakfast is served.

7,"Make-These-Fantastic-and-Easy-Sugar-F","Make These Fantastic and Easy Sugar-Free Peanut Butter Cookies","Giving up <a href=""https://eheintl.com/sugar/"">sugar</a> can leave us feeling deprived and as though we'll never eat dessert again. But this recipe for sugar-free peanut butter cookies is proof that cutting out most sugar doesn't mean needing to give up treats altogether! These cookies taste great, and you'll feel like you're indulging... but <em>without</em> wrecking havoc on your system.

Processed sugar adds unnecessary calories to your diet <a href=""https://www.organics.org/natural-vs-processed-sugars/"">without giving you the nutrients you need</a>. The body is not particularly interested in calories themselves. Its primary focus is getting specific nutrients. Everything from fluid balance, nerve function, metabolism, energy production, bone structure, and <a href=""https://eheintl.com/digestive_health/"">proper digestion</a> all require specific macronutrients and micronutrients. When we fill our diet with nutritionally empty calories — such as sugar, processed wheat, and poor quality dairy — our body continues to give us hunger signals, since it hasn't received what it needs. This can lead to <a href=""https://eheintl.com/overeating/"">overeating</a> and weight gain over time.

Fructose, when consumed through fruit, where the micronutrients and fiber slow the release of sugar into the bloodstream, isn't something to fear. However, when consumed in excess in the form of processed and packaged sugars, soda, and desserts, it will be converted into glycogen and stored by the liver. For individuals who chronically overeat these foods, the liver becomes too full of glycogen and begin to turn fructose into fat. This can lead to a condition called fatty liver and, if left untreated, eventually liver disease.

Organic stevia has been used for centuries. It is a plant with naturally sweet leaves. While the stevia plant can be grown and used in its natural form, more conveniently it has also been turned into a powder which can be found in most grocery stores. Be sure to choose 100% organic stevia to avoid other additives and chemicals some brands use in their formulas. Since it does not affect the blood sugar, stevia can be a great option for preventing metabolic syndrome, keeping mood and energy stable, and creating steady hunger levels. Stevia also contains antioxidant properties, which helps fight inflammation in the body (whereas regular sugar actually <em>causes</em> inflammation in the body).

3 tablespoons cacao
2 eggs
1/4 cup chopped peanuts
1 teaspoon stevia powder*
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

8,"Make-These-Amazing-and-Healthy-Holida","Make These Amazing and Healthy Holiday Cocktails","The holidays are a time to <a href=""https://eheintl.com/overeating/"">eat</a>, drink, and be merry. But that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice <em>all</em> of the healthy habits you're trying to keep! Holiday cocktails can be healthy (or, at least, <em>healthier</em>) than you might expect, as long as you give some thought to the ingredients ahead of time.

We've come up with a few modified recipes for holiday cocktails (including one that's easily turned into an alcohol-free ""mocktail""), each of which offers some nice health benefits along with the usual seasonal cheer.

<em>The recipes below serve eight delicious, healthy holiday cocktails apiece</em> <em>unless otherwise indicated</em>.

<em>And, of course, please drink responsibly!</em>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Pomegranate Sparkler</strong></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5172"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-08-at-4.03.46-PM-1024x947.png"" alt=""Pomegranate Sparkler"" width=""500"" height=""462"" />

Want to add some lush color to your cocktail offerings? How about some critical nutrients and powerful preventive health benefits? <a href=""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318385.php"">Pomegranate juice</a> has anti-inflammatory properties, comes packed with antioxidants, and contains polyphenols shown to counteract <a href=""https://eheintl.com/prostate-cancer/"">prostate</a> and breast cancers. The fruit is also good for your heart, with research showing that it can help lower blood pressure and reduce plaque in the carotid artery. (How's that for a holiday gift?) Pomegranate juice is also a good source of vitamins C and E, as well as potassium. That all makes these sparkling holiday cocktails an exciting option for you and your loved ones.

<strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong>:
eight ounces of pomegranate juice (be sure to get 100% juice with no added sugar)
four ounces of fruit liqueur (such as Curacao or Grand Marnier)
four teaspoons of lime juice (or lime wedges)
four teaspoons of pomegranate seeds
several sprigs of mint (if so desired)
sparkling wine (chilled)

<strong><em>Preparation</em></strong>:
Sprinkle pomegranate seeds into Champagne flutes, followed by the pomegranate juice and your chosen liqueur. Add lime and then pour the chilled sparkling wine. Top off with mint and enjoy!

&nbsp;

Eggnog is among the most polarizing holiday drinks, so even if it's not your favorite, there's a good chance someone at your party may ask, ""Hey, where's the nog?"" One major problem with traditional eggnog in modern times? Lots of people are <a href=""https://www.vegan.com/dairy-free/"">going off dairy</a>. Fortunately, we have a solution. This dairy-free eggnog recipe is just as delicious as the standard version, but substitutes almond milk and coconut milk for the cow milk your guests may be trying to avoid. And it couldn't be any simpler to make!

<strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong>:
four cups of coconut milk
four cups of almond milk
eight large egg yolks
one cup of pure maple syrup
two teaspoons of ground cinnamon
two teaspoons of nutmeg
two teaspoons of pure vanilla extract

<strong><em>Preparation</em></strong>:
Combine all ingredients (except nutmeg) in a blender. Blend for approximately two minutes. Egg yolks should be fully processed. Chill in refrigerator until ready to serve, then pour and top with nutmeg.
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Ginger Cider Hot Toddy</strong></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5169"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Hot-Toddy-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""Hot Toddy"" width=""600"" height=""400"" />

It's hard to find anything more comforting on a chilly winter's night than this classic drink, whether you include alcohol or not! In fact, one of the best things about a hot toddy is that it can be tailored for almost any taste — since the tea and cider varieties are up to you — and still be great. This version includes <a href=""https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/ginger.html"">ginger</a>, which aids digestion, boosts immune function, and has been shown to have a positive impact on everything from cholesterol to respiration to reducing nausea. If you make yours with green tea, you'll also get the benefit of polyphenols.

<em>Makes one mug</em>.

<strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong>:

two cups of warm apple cider
one tea bag
one tablespoon of honey
1/8 teaspoon of ginger
one lemon
one cinnamon stick
one shot of your preferred whiskey (optional)

<em><strong>Preparation</strong></em>:

9,"Learn-How-to-Make-Gluten-Free-Banana-","Learn How to Make Gluten-Free Banana Bread","Banana bread is classic comfort food (especially when you have overripe bananas you don't want to waste). <em>Gluten-free</em> banana bread is just as tasty, while also letting people on low- or no-gluten diets enjoy the treat. And the version we make is even healthier, since we've removed the processed sugar and refined ingredients included in traditional recipes. The result is a wholesome gluten-free banana bread you'll love!
<p class=""gmail-p1""><a href=""https://eheintl.com/healthy-snacks/"">Bananas</a> are the perfect base for baked goods, since they keep bread moist without needing excessive amounts of oil or butter. They also contain many important nutrients. Additionally, they're full of <a href=""https://eheintl.com/digestive_health_fiber/"">fiber</a>, which helps slow the digestion of sugar into the bloodstream. One banana also contains more than a third of our daily vitamin B6 requirement. B vitamins are crucial for metabolism, energy, a well-functioning nervous system, and skin health. B6, specifically, improves brain function, facilitates the manufacturing of hemoglobin, and is good for healthy immune function. It also helps to maintain a positive mood, since it factors in the production of serotonin.<span class=""gmail-Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""gmail-p1"">For fat, we've chosen <a href=""https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/other/ghee-clarified-butter.html"">ghee</a> (with the option of using coconut oil if you're vegan). Ghee is a form of clarified butter — meaning the milk proteins are removed, but the vitamins stay intact (unlike commercially produced butter). Ghee is full of Omega-3 and Omega-9 fatty acids; it's also one of the best sources of conjugated linoleic acid, which has anti-cancer properties. Since the milk proteins are removed from ghee, many individuals with dairy sensitivities find that they can tolerate it well, making it the perfect substitute for our gluten-free banana bread recipe!<span class=""gmail-Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""gmail-p1"">We've created a slight twist by adding raw <a href=""https://begoodorganics.com/blogs/subscriber-only-recipes/7991527-cacao-5-little-known-benefits-of-this-amazonian-superfood"">cacao</a> to the mix. This gives our gluten-free banana bread a rich chocolate flavor, so you'll feel like you're eating dessert! The antioxidant levels in cacao are incredibly high — 40 times higher than blueberries, in fact. It's also rich in iron, making it an excellent dietary addition for vegans and vegetarians who don't consume iron-rich animal products. You'll find more calcium in cacao than in dairy milk, which is good for preventing osteoporosis and helpful for growing children and teens. And cacao also has calming properties, since it's so rich in magnesium, which is often touted as the ""relaxation mineral"" since it helps steady nerves, reduces anxiety, and may help people with insomnia.<span class=""gmail-Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>

10,"Why-You-Need-to-Practice-Mindful-Eati","Why You Need to Practice Mindful Eating","<strong>How to Practice Mindful Eating</strong>

In a broad sense, <a href=""https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/mindfulness/definition"">mindfulness</a> is simply taking notice of your thoughts, behaviors, and habits. Mindful eating <a href=""https://www.thecenterformindfuleating.org"">means</a> we take our time to eat, observe when we are hungry and when we feel full, and pay attention to what we eat and where it comes from. Mindful eating means we understand that <em>how</em> we eat is an important consideration, just like <em>what</em> we eat.

Here are five ways to establish mindful eating habits:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Listen to your body</strong><strong>. </strong>In our frenetically paced culture, we often lose track of the fundamentals of eating. Pay attention to your physical hunger signals, and observe when your body feels full. Often, we eat too rapidly and ignore when our bodies say it's time to stop. Slowing down is the best way to ensure our bodies have the chance to express <a href=""https://eheintl.com/nutritionfactslabel/"">nutritional needs</a>, and it also makes eating more enjoyable.</li>
 	<li><strong>Turn off the phone and TV. </strong>Make your personal and family meals as distraction-free as possible. Try to eat at the same established times each day. Make space for some quiet time at the dinner table. Keep conversation as gentle, joyful, and stress-free as you can. If you do decide to have movie nights with dinner in front of the TV, do so consciously, and perhaps only on weekends.</li>
 	<li><strong>Savor your food. </strong>Pay attention to all the things you love about your meal — the textures, colors, and flavors. Allow yourself to focus t0tally on the experience. Slow down, breathe, and give yourself the time to fully enjoy your food. Not only will your pleasure in eating increase, you will <a href=""https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/mindfulness-helps-us-digest-and-enjoy-our-food"">digest and assimilate your meal better</a></li>
 	<li><strong>Know your food and where it comes from. </strong>Choose the highest quality fresh and natural foods you can afford. Engage yourself in the meal-making process. Do you know who grew your food and where it originated? Maybe you can find a local market or bakery where you interact with the people who supply your ingredients. A simple appreciation for the food you eat can increase your enjoyment exponentially. And the more mindful you are about the <a href=""https://eheintl.com/healthyeating/"">quality of foods</a> you and your family eat (and where they come from), the more likely you are to make better choices.</li>
 	<li><strong>Balance food as comfort with nutritional needs. </strong><a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/inside-out/201309/emotional-eating-5-reasons-you-can-t-stop"">Sometimes we eat to fulfill emotional needs</a>, rather than considering the quality or nutritional value of our meal. Healthy, natural foods can be prepared in ways that provide plenty of enjoyment and comfort <em>without</em> sacrificing nutrition. Mindful eating leads you to eat what you want, but in a higher quality and cleaner way. The more fresh foods you eat, the better they will taste to you.</li>
</ol>
With mindful eating, we train ourselves to pay closer attention to our bodies' real needs. The process of cooking and eating should be a pleasure — but it also needs to be nourishing. The more deliberate and conscious we are, the more we get out of it.

11,"This-Gluten-Free-Stuffing-Is-Perfect-","This Gluten-Free Stuffing Is Perfect for Thanksgiving","Gluten-free stuffing is becoming more mainstream as more people give up gluten. Some individuals (like those with celiac disease) can get very sick if they eat it. Other people may have more mild intolerances or sensitivities to gluten. Others go <a href=""https://eheintl.com/healthy-blueberry-muffins/"">gluten-free</a> because they find it keeps their skin more clear, improves digestion, gives them more energy, and is otherwise a positive for their health.

<strong>What Exactly Is Gluten?</strong>

Gluten refers to the glutenin and gliadin proteins found in any wheat, rye, or barley products. It's responsible for the sticky texture of wheat-based dough, and gives bread the chewy texture that we all love. People with celiac disease can't process gluten, which activates their immune response. This leads the body to attack not only the gluten, but also the digestive system, causing horrible stomach cramping and longer-term consequences.

Some without celiac disease experience intolerance on a milder scale, with bloating, stomach aches, digestion issues, breakouts, mood decline, and energy slumps. If you suspect you have an intolerance to gluten, doing an elimination diet (removing all allergins for 2-3 weeks, then slowly adding suspected allergins one at a time) can be helpful in determining your personal response to gluten and other foods like dairy.

Even if your body does tolerate gluten, try to choose organic, whole grain products with no added sugar. Preferably, wheat products are sprouted, which makes the nutrients found in grains more accessible to the human body.

<strong>The Gluten-Free Stuffing Solution</strong>

If you do decide to go gluten-free, it can be challenging to miss out on foods you once loved. Especially around the holidays, when baked goods and classic holiday recipes are abundant, it's easy to feel like something's lacking. We've created this gluten-free stuffing recipe to help you enjoy the full Thanksgiving spread. Not only is this recipe full of flavor, but it comes with a variety of health benefits.

We've included antioxidant-rich produce like carrots, onions, apples, and celery. We've also chosen wholesome fats like ghee and olive oil, and plenty of herbs to add both flavor and nutrients.

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

1.5 loaves gluten-free bread (preferably a sourdough variety like Udi's)
4 fresh sage leaves
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 cups bone broth or turkey broth*
3-4 large carrots, sliced
1 apple, chopped
2 celery stock, sliced
1 small yellow onion, chopped
3-4 cloves garlic, minced
2 eggs
1/2 cup ghee*
1/4 cup olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

*To make this recipe vegan, use vegetable broth and replace ghee with olive oil

<strong>Step 1: Preheat oven to 225. Grease a casserole dish. Cut bread into large bite-size pieces. Spread bread cubes onto a baking sheet. Bake for 45 minutes, to dry out bread.</strong>

<strong>Step 2: While bread bakes, cut vegetables. Heat ghee and olive oil over medium, cook onion for three minutes. Add carrots and celery and cook for another for five minutes. Next add apple, garlic, herbs, and salt and pepper, then cook for an additional three minutes. Set aside.</strong>

<strong>Step 3: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk eggs and broth together. Toss in bread. Let the bread sit in the egg-broth mixture, tossing every five minutes until the mixture has fully soaked all of the bread (this is important to avoid dry stuffing). Once the bread is soaked, toss with vegetables and pour into a casserole dish.</strong>

12,"Make-This-Wonderful-and-Healthy-Pumpk","Make This Wonderful and Healthy Pumpkin Pie","Making a healthy pumpkin pie can be tricky. While pumpkin on its own has great nutritional value, the traditional Thanksgiving dessert we know is <a href=""https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Many-Calories-Pumpkin-Pie-36285836"">filled with</a> sugar, dairy, and processed wheat — a far cry from clean eating. This year, we’ve switched to a gluten-free crust, clean sugars, and organic pumpkin for a version that’s just as tasty but <em>much</em> healthier.

We’ve chosen a store-bought crust to make preparation of this healthy pumpkin pie simpler, although making your own crust is, of course, always an option. Using a gluten-free or whole grain crust helps ensure that the dessert will be free from refined starches that lead to a spike in blood sugar. It's preferable to pick an option with <a href=""https://eheintl.com/digestive_health_fiber/"">fiber</a>, which will slow the absorption of sugar into the blood while also aiding digestion. Fiber promotes a feeling of fullness and helps to prevent overeating. Additionally, it helps feed good gut bacteria, improves immunity, and removes excess hormones like estrogen.

We’ve given you the option to use canned pumpkin for this pie; if possible, choose organic, pure pumpkin. It makes the dessert more dense in nutrients. You’ll see other canned options called something like “pumpkin pie filling,” so be sure to check that pumpkin is the only listed ingredient. In addition to the fiber found in a properly chosen crust, one can of pumpkin adds seven grams of fiber.

Pumpkin, like most brightly-colored orange, yellow, and red produce, is rich in beta-carotene, a nutrient which the body converts to Vitamin A. Vitamin A is important for eye health, reproductive function, and immunity. If you’ve chosen a fresh pumpkin, be sure to save the seeds. They are rich in potassium, magnesium, and zinc. They have also been shown to contain properties that fight off certain chronic diseases like cancer.

The fat found in coconut milk is useful in absorbing nutrients like Vitamin A. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are all fat soluble, meaning they require fat in order for the body to absorb and utilize them. Pairing foods containing these nutrients with fats found in coconut, avocado, olive oil, and raw nuts (to name a few), is important. It’s also a reason to avoid diets extremely low in fat. They can result in vitamin deficiencies and a slew of other ailments in the body.

13,"Warm-Up-With-This-Simple-and-Amazing-","Warm Up With This Simple and Amazing Butternut Squash Soup","Few foods represent autumn better than butternut squash. Roasted, this vegetable caramelizes into a buttery, decadent treat. We've taken the roasting process one step further to create this simple yet incredibly flavorful butternut squash soup that will wow anyone.

Fall is peak season for butternut squash, so the flavor will be at its best. In addition to serving as an ideal base for a blended soup, butternut squash has a number of health benefits. It's full of dietary fiber, which improves digestion and lowers the risk for heart disease. It's also rich in B6, which helps elevate your moods, improves brain function, and facilitates healthy blood pressure levels.

The rich, orange hue of butternut squash can be credited to nutrients known as carotenoids. Carotenoids are a type of antioxidant commonly found in yellow, orange, and red produce. They protect eye health, prevent cardiovascular disease, help skin health, and even improve male fertility. Eating carotenoid-rich foods with fat helps improve its bioavailability to the body, so drizzling a little olive oil on top of the squash is a great idea for both flavor and health.

Beyond adding even more taste to the butternut squash soup, sage has long been used for its medicinal purposes. The oils found in sage are both antiseptic and antibacterial, making it the perfect herb to choose as cold and flu season kicks into high gear. Sage is also rich in vitamin K, which helps activate proteins produced by the liver, ensuring proper blood clotting. Bone metabolism (which allows us to replace old bone cells with healthy ones) and the regulation of calcium in the blood are two other important tasks in which vitamin K plays a role.

Choosing high quality, organic vegetable broth makes this butternut squash soup vegan and yields even more health benefits. The broth helps hydrate the body, which improves digestion, regulates body temperature, increases circulation and energy, and prevents muscle cramps. Additionally, the broth retains many of the antioxidants and minerals found in the vegetables and herbs used to make it. Saving produce scraps you'd otherwise toss and storing them in the freezer is a great way to utilize food waste <em>and </em>produce a homemade vegetable broth.

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>1 large butternut squash</li>
 	<li>1/2 small onion</span></li>
 	<li>1 small shallot</span></li>
 	<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</span></li>
 	<li>3-4 cloves garlic</span></li>

 	<li>3-4 thyme sprigs</span></li>
 	<li>1-2 sage bunches</span></li>
 	<li>salt</span></li>
 	<li>pepper</span></li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 1: Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Cut butternut squash in half, scoop out seeds, and place on a baking sheet flesh side up. Coat in olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 45-60 minutes, until flesh is golden brown and easily pierced with a fork.</strong>

14,"How-to-Make-Healthy-Homemade-Granola-","How to Make Healthy Homemade Granola Bars","Homemade granola bars can be a great healthy addition to packed lunches and after school snacks now that fall is in full swing. While pre-packaged foods are certainly convenient, we can't always guarantee they contain the most <a href=""https://eheintl.com/healthyeating/"">wholesome ingredients</a> for our families. We've created these no-bake chocolate-cherry homemade granola bars filled will fiber, healthy fats, and flavors that kids and adults alike will love.

<strong>Oatmeal for Heart Health</strong>

The <a href=""http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/bonnie-taub-dix-nutrition-intuition/reasons-why-you-should-eat-oatmeal-every-day/"">soluble fiber found in oatmeal</a> has been linked to lowering bad cholesterol (LDL), which decreases the risk for heart disease. It also helps keep you satiated longer, improves digestion, and assists in the maintenance of lower body weight. Meanwhile, the antioxidant content in oats fights inflammation throughout the body, which is great for heart function and warding off diseases like cancer.

<strong>Cherries for Restful Sleep</strong>

We love the tart flavor of cherries to balance the sweet cacao in this recipe. Plus, they pack an even bigger antioxidant punch than oatmeal. The type of antioxidants found in cherries blocks inflammatory enzymes, promoting health and decreasing muscular and joint pain. Cherries are rich in many micronutrients, but specifically in melatonin and tryptophan, a calming combination that facilitates restful sleep. In one study, participants were given unsweetened cherry juice for two weeks, and on average slept soundly for 90 minutes longer than the control group. For these homemade granola bars, choose an unsweetened variety, as <a href=""https://eheintl.com/naturally_occurring_sugars_versus_added_sugars/"">processed sugar</a> is linked to breakouts, inflammation, and obesity.

<strong>Cacao for Staying Calm</strong>

Our homemade granola bars recipe uses cacao, which has more nutrients than processed cocoa powder, but the same great chocolate flavor. Cacao has a higher calcium content than cow's milk and is among the most reliable plant sources of iron. It's also known for magnesium, a mineral that is crucial for combating stress and staying calm. Magnesium has been shown to improve ADHD symptoms in children and reduce insomnia. If you choose chocolate chips over cacao, be sure to pick a darker variety with less added sugar.

<strong>Almond Butter for Blood Sugar Regulation</strong>

We've chosen wholesome carbohydrate sources for our homemade granola bars, but it's still important to pair them with healthy fats and protein to ensure sugars enter the bloodstream more slowly (the fiber content also helps with this). It's crucial to get a steady flow of energy from our snacks and meals, rather than a sharp increase that leads to a post-spike crash. Blood sugar stabilization helps with mood, appetite control, and sound sleep. Choosing raw nut butter keeps the micronutrient content higher. Almond butter provides a solid dose of monounsaturated fats (which are anti-inflammatory) and Vitamin E, which helps lower bad cholesterol levels.

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

2-3 cups rolled oats

1 cup cacao nibs, dark chocolate chips, or carob chips

1 cup almond butter

3/4 cup dried cherries

2/3 cup maple syrup or honey

1/4 cacao powder

1 tablespoon coconut oil

2 teaspoons vanilla

1/2 teaspoon salt

<strong>Step 1: </strong>Add almond butter, maple syrup, coconut oil, and salt to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 15-second increments until warm enough to mix thoroughly.

<strong>Step 2: </strong>Add cacao and vanilla to almond butter and mix thoroughly. Next add oats, chocolate chips, and cherries and fold in (optionally save some chocolate chips for the top of granola bars). Add the first two cups of oats first, then slowly add the third (if you prefer a dryer bar, add more oats).

15,"These-Healthy-Blueberry-Muffins-Make-","These Healthy Blueberry Muffins Make Mornings Wonderful","You've likely heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. There are countless benefits to <a href=""https://eheintl.com/healthy-eating-patterns/"">eating a nutritious breakfast</a> — including a higher metabolism, weight loss, normalized blood sugar, and a better mood. Unfortunately, mornings can also be hectic, so adding a <a href=""http://www.health.com/food/cheap-healthy-foods"">healthy but delicious breakfast</a> to your routine may feel impossible.

Grab-and-go breakfasts make sense when you’re pressed for time, but too often people reach for sugar-filled pastries or other easy but unhealthy options. We have a solution. Try these healthy blueberry muffins, which are gluten free, loaded with antioxidants, and contain no processed sugar!

<strong>Healthy Blueberry Muffins Deliver Antioxidants</strong>

Healthy blueberry muffins take advantage of one of nature's <a href=""http://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-benefits-of-blueberries#section1"">most nutritionally beneficial fruits</a>. Blueberries are high in antioxidants. What does that mean?

Many stressors, ranging from smoking to exercising, can lead to the formation of free radicals in our bodies. This creates a risk for excessive inflammation, damage to our DNA, and chronic issues like cancer and heart disease.

Some free radical formation is normal, which is why the body produces antioxidants on its own. However, this function decreases as we age, and it simply isn't sufficient to deal with the level of toxins we are exposed to through modern pollution, stress and diet. As a result, it is crucial to consume antioxidants through our diet. Many organic vegetables and fruits are rich in antioxidants. Blueberries are believed to have the highest concentration among common fruits and vegetables. They are particularly high in flavonoids, a type of antioxidant that gives blueberries their rich color, and are also helpful in detoxifying our system.

<strong>Choose Whole Flours and Sugars</strong>

We've chosen oatmeal rather than processed white flour for this healthy blueberry muffins recipe. Oatmeal is denser in fiber, which facilitates digestion. It also helps lower cholesterol and slows the rate at which sugars enter the blood stream. Coconut palm sugar is also known for having a milder impact on blood sugar levels. It is important to choose foods that don't cause spikes in our blood sugar in order to create more stable hunger levels, mood, and a healthier weight. When we regularly eat foods that cause jumps in blood sugar — like white bread, pasta, and sugary desserts — we also risk insulin resistance and eventually Type 2 diabetes.

16,"EHE-Guidelines-for-Good-Health-After-","EHE Guidelines for Good Health After Hurricane Harvey","Tropical Storm Harvey continues to devastate the Gulf Coast, with record rainfall still pounding the region. Millions of Americans in Houston and countless small towns across Texas and Louisiana are now facing destructive, deadly flooding.

EHE's thoughts are with everyone affected by the storm and its aftermath. We have a clinic and affiliated physicians in Houston, as well as family, friends, colleagues, and clients throughout the area. While a catastrophe like Harvey creates emergencies that make personal care incredibly difficult, it's never more important than during a disaster to follow basic medical protocols to ensure your safety.

<strong>Please read the following EHE recommendations for staying healthy in the wake of the storm</strong>.

<strong>Hygiene and Drinking Water</strong>

While basic hygiene is always important, it's especially vital during floods when floodwaters can carry sewage, pesticides, and other highly dangerous substances. Be sure to wash your hands and face with water that's been boiled or disinfected to reduce your exposure to germs. Similarly, if your community's tap water has been contaminated or compromised, only use properly cleaned water to drink, prepare food, or brush your teeth. See the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/drinking/making-water-safe.html""><strong>Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) recommendations for making water safe in an emergency</strong></a>.

<strong>Infectious Disease</strong>

While new outbreaks of diseases <em>not</em> common in the United States (such as cholera or typhoid) will not occur after Harvey or similar storms, other communicable illnesses like diarrhea and respiratory illnesses may spread due to compromised public sanitation, crowding in shelters, and other factors. Pay attention to specific alerts from local and state health departments. Most importantly, do everything possible to maintain personal hygiene and the integrity of your food and water. The CDC also advises people in post-hurricane flood zones to be careful to <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/facts.html""><strong>protect against mosquitoes</strong></a> since the insects can carry a number of diseases and thrive in standing water. Here is additional information on <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/infectious.html""><strong>specific infectious diseases</strong></a> associated with natural disasters.

<strong>Tetanus</strong>

Floodwaters can contain debris that may cause cuts or puncture wounds and those same waters could be contaminated with bacteria which is why there is a heightened media focus on the risk of contracting tetanus however, <a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2017/08/29/tetanus-houston-floods/""><strong>infectious disease experts caution <em>against</em> public panic regarding tetanus</strong></a>. While tetanus infection is serious, mere exposure to floodwaters is NOT in and of itself a reason to get an immediate tetanus booster shot, despite certain reports. If you sustain a wound during a flood, it should be evaluated for possible tetanus treatment no differently than it would be in a non-disaster situation. If you've already been vaccinated on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/tetanus.html""><strong>CDC-recommended schedule</strong></a> (a booster shot every 10 years for adults), no additional vaccination is necessary. In most cases, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/facts.html""><strong>properly treating wounds</strong></a> and consulting with a doctor if you are not sure of your tetanus vaccination history should be the guiding protocol.

<strong>Safety When Reentering Your House</strong>

If your home is flooded, it is imperative to take <em>extreme caution</em> when you return. All utilities — electricity, natural gas, propane, etc. — must be shut off to avoid potential electrocution or explosion. Depending on the extent of the flooding, dangerous downed power lines may be obscured, sewage or metal debris could be in the water, ventilation of carbon monoxide could be blocked, and other hazards could be present. Always consult with the police and fire departments, as well as local utility providers, to determine whether it's safe to enter the house. For more information, see <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/mold/reenter.html""><strong>CDC guidelines on reentering flooded homes</strong></a> and additional <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/floods/after.html""><strong>cleanup recommendations</strong></a>.

<strong>Mold</strong>

A major health risk in the coming weeks and months will be the mold in buildings hit by rain and flooding. Experts say that any structure flooded during an event on this scale should be presumed to contain mold if not thoroughly dried within 48 hours. Given the prolonged nature of this storm, the mold issue could be particularly widespread. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/floods.pdf""><strong>recommendations for residential flood cleanup</strong></a>, and the CDC has a <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/pdf/flyer-get-rid-of-mold.pdf""><strong>checklist of the first and most important steps to take to combat flood-related mold</strong></a>. A comprehensive and more detailed guide to mold from both agencies can be <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mold/cleanup.htm""><strong>seen here</strong></a>.

<strong>Mental Health</strong>

Natural disasters trigger spikes in stress and anxiety, can worsen existing mental health problems, and often impede standard mental health care delivery. If you are experiencing emotional distress due to the storm and need help, contact the <strong>National Disaster Distress Helpline</strong>. It is multilingual, critical crisis support, available toll-free and 24 hours a day via phone (1-800-985-5990) and SMS (text ‘TalkWithUs’ to 66746). For more help in coping with the trauma caused by emergencies like Harvey, <a href=""https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/harvey2017/Pages/mental-health.aspx""><strong>see these mental health resources at the Department of Health and Human Services</strong></a>.

<strong>Animals</strong>

With floodwaters disrupting the environment and displacing species of every kind, there are widespread reports (and social media documentation) of fire ants, snakes, alligators surfacing in areas in and around Houston where they’re usually not spotted. Wildlife experts advise people to exercise the same common sense they would in normal circumstances: Stay clear, even if the animals don’t seem dangerous. Be especially vigilant, given how floodwaters can keep animals hidden until they’re very close. And, when reentering your home after it’s safe, be sure to check for any animals that may have taken up residence amid the storm.

17,"This-Terrific-Mediterranean-Quinoa-Sa","This Terrific Mediterranean Quinoa Salad Is Great for Your Heart","A Mediterranean diet wards off disease, promotes wellness, and keeps weight healthy and stable. But what characterizes this <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801"">approach to nutrition</a>? Well, you'll find people in the Mediterranean region eating lots of <a href=""https://eheintl.com/preferred_source_of_vitamins/"">fresh vegetables and fruits</a>, unprocessed grains, seafood, high-protein (and high-quality) dairy, raw nuts, and, of course, olive oil. If you're looking to eat this way, most of your grocery shopping can be done around the perimeter of the store (think proteins and tons of produce), with limited trips to center aisles for certain grains, nuts, and legumes. While you may not be changing your whole diet just yet, we encourage you to try this flavorful Mediterranean quinoa salad as a delicious gateway to Mediterranean cuisine.

<strong>Mediterranean Quinoa Salad: An Excellent Source of Protein</strong>

Quinoa is one of the only plant protein sources that is a ""complete"" protein. The body produces many amino acids on its own, but there are nine amino acids we must consume in food, and they are crucial for survival. These are called essential amino acids, and quinoa contains all nine of them. Just one cup of this heart-healthy grain has eight grams of protein, meaning regularly including it in your diet can shave off the number of animal products you need as protein sources. Lowering your overall consumption of animal products is great for the environment and lowers your risk of diseases like cancer and heart disease. This Mediterranean quinoa salad is the perfect way to get protein.

<strong>Olive Oil Promotes Heart Health</strong>

Olive oil is rich in <a href=""https://eheintl.com/dietary-fat/"">monounsaturated fats</a>, which are often missing in the modern American diet. The fatty acids in olive oil are called oleic acid. Oleic acid has been shown to reduce inflammation throughout the body, which promotes health and helps to prevent a slew of diseases. In addition to the health benefits of its type of fat, olive oil also contains a concentration of antioxidants shown to fight free radicals, improve skin health, and prevent cancer. The antioxidants can be damaged by exposure to light and heat, so always store olive oil in a dark and cool spot.

<strong>It's All About the Herbs </strong>

Every ingredient in this Mediterranean quinoa salad was chosen to promote health. Each vegetable is rich in antioxidants, which are important for counteracting the damaging pollutants, poor food choices, and <a href=""https://eheintl.com/manage_your_stress_with_these_techniques/"">stress we face each day</a>. But it's not just the veggies that improve our wellness - both garlic and parsley come with their own benefits, too. Garlic in its raw form will not only add bite to the dish, but also stimulate the immune system and help fight off illness.

Parsley is an herb you'll find in many Mediterranean dishes. It has long been used in the region to help diabetic patients, as parsley has been shown to keep blood sugar levels stable. Adding it to your dishes can help prevent insulin resistance, maintain energy levels, and even fight irritability. It's a great way to top this Mediterranean quinoa salad.

This recipe for grilled shrimp skewers adds a nutritious, delicious option to your menu. It’s easy to cook, and the flavorful sauce can be stored in the fridge for a week, making it simple to prepare in advance. See how to make these incredible grilled shrimp skewers with pesto sauce below!

<strong>Behold the Nutritional Power of Shrimp</strong>

Shrimp is an excellent low-calorie source of protein. A dozen shrimp can total just 85-100 calories while packing 15 grams of protein! Protein is a crucial macronutrient to include at every meal. Aiming for at least 15-20 grams per meal is a good general goal in order to increase satiety, keep you full longer, and maintain muscle mass.

Muscle burns more calories than other forms of tissue, so maintaining muscle is a great way to improve metabolic function, boost energy, and strengthen overall health. A useful guideline is that each meal should keep you full for 4-6 hours, which helps to prevent mindless snacking or impulsive food choices. If you're hungry much sooner than 4 hours after a meal, it may mean you ate too little, had simple carbohydrates which caused a blood sugar spike and quick drop, or didn't include enough protein. Besides keeping you full, protein slows the rate at which food is digested and absorbed. This helps to steady blood sugar levels, thereby stabilizing mood and energy, as well as preventing diabetes.

Shrimp is also rich in selenium, a mineral that helps to counter free radicals and oxidation throughout the body. It's also been shown to prevent certain types of cancers. Selenium's anti-inflammation and -oxidation properties also decrease the risk of heart disease. Additionally, good thyroid health necessitates adequate selenium since it's required for the production of thyroid hormone. The thyroid regulates metabolism, which affects weight and energy levels. Selenium also boosts immunity, helping ward off common colds and the flu.

<strong>Pesto Sauce Boosts Flavor and Health</strong>

The pesto sauce in this recipe comes with many of its own health benefits. Mint is <a href=""https://eheintl.com/digestive_health/"">incredible for digestion</a>, helping to fight inflammation in the gut and keeping things moving smoothly. Spinach is high in fiber, meaning it's also good for digestion, and because it's served raw it retains full micronutrient advantages. Garlic is incredible for immunity; it's antibacterial and antiviral, helping to ward off bad bacteria in the digestive tract. It also contains allicin, which stimulates immunity cells and keeps your immune system at peak performance. Overall, these grilled shrimp skewers offer a lot in the way of both nutrition and taste.

19,"How-to-Save-Sun-Damaged-Skin","How to Save Sun Damaged Skin","Sun damaged skin becomes more of a problem as we age. Excessive exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays can cause changes to the skin collectively known as <a href=""http://www.skincancer.org/healthy-lifestyle/anti-aging/what-is-photoaging"">photoaging</a>. The dermatological development is characterized by a coarse and dry skin appearance; other features include freckling, discoloration, a leathery look, and deep wrinkles. Sun damaged skin can happen to anyone, not just those who <a href=""https://eheintl.com/skin_cancer_foundation/"">go tanning regularly</a> or work outdoors. The right course of action for managing the effects of photoaging depends on its severity, as well as factors such as your age and overall health, the specific type of damage sustained, and how well you tolerate certain therapies and treatments. You may also have an inclination toward the general type of treatment, whether you prefer natural options or a more standard medical approach.

Of course, aging cannot be avoided entirely. But good skin care, combined with <a href=""http://www.eatingwell.com/nutrition_health/healthy_aging/healthy_aging_diet_guidelines"">a healthy diet and lifestyle</a>, will slow some of its physical impact and soften the effects of time and sun exposure. If you have sun damaged skin due to photoaging, you can improve its appearance and avoid further harm. Here are some options to prevent and reverse the effects of too much sun on your skin.

<strong>Natural Treatments for Sun Damaged Skin</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Aloe Vera</strong> - Aloe vera is one of the most effective natural remedies for sun damaged skin. It contains 150 trace elements and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, copper, zinc, selenium, potassium, iron, and amino acids. For best results, go directly to the source and cut open an aloe vera leaf, extracting the gel. Apply the gel directly to your skin, let it dry, and then rinse with cool water. Reapply several times per day to heal and soothe your skin.</li>
 	<li><strong>Honey</strong> - <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609166/"">Honey is a natural antibiotic</a> and helps trap moisture to the skin. It also contains natural antioxidants, which are found in particularly high amounts in the darker varieties of honey. These antioxidants help to heal and neutralize free-radical damage to the skin from the sun, pollution, and stress. At-home skin treatments made with raw, dark honey will help to improve the tone, texture, and moisture content of your skin.</li>
 	<li><strong>Lemon Juice </strong>- Lemon juice contains natural alpha hydroxy and glycolic acids that gently exfoliate the skin to improve texture and uneven skin tone caused by sun damage. You can make a homemade toner by mixing one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice with a half cup of pure water. Apply to the skin with a cotton ball or pad, and let it dry for 30 to 60 minutes. You can then leave the preparation on your skin or rinse with cool water.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vitamin A </strong>- Eat foods rich in <a href=""https://eheintl.com/the_13_essential_vitamins/"">vitamin A</a>, such as eggs, fish, and brightly colored vegetables, as part of a healthy overall diet featuring fresh, natural foods. Vitamin A is a natural antioxidant that promotes the healing and regeneration of sun damaged skin.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Medical Treatments for Sun Damaged Skin</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Prescription Retinoids</strong> - Retinoids help even skin tone, and increase the amount of collagen in your skin, facilitating a more youthful appearance. A doctor can prescribe a retinoid cream or serum, like Retin A, for a full-strength effect. You can also opt for the less potent, over-the-counter form of retinol.</li>
 	<li><strong>Microdermabrasion</strong> - Microdermabrasion gently sands and exfoliates the skin with small crystals, grains, or diamond tips. The process removes the outermost layer of skin, promotes the growth of collagen, and improves hyperpigmentation due to sun damage.</li>
 	<li><strong>Laser Therapy</strong> - Short pulses of intense, concentrated light remove targeted layers or areas of the skin’s surface, reducing facial wrinkles, scarring, blemishes and uneven skin tone.</li>
 	<li><strong>Chemical Peels</strong> - Chemical peels remove sun damaged skin from the upper layers. You can apply some peels, such as alpha-hydroxy or salicylic acid creams, yourself. A deeper peel is performed by a dermatologist.</li>
</ul>
While some of <a href=""http://www.skincancer.org/healthy-lifestyle/anti-aging/repair-and-even-reverse-signs-of-sun-damage"">the effects of photoaging can be reversed and significantly improved</a>, prevention is your best bet. Wear a broad spectrum (containing UVA and UVB protection) sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher, every day, regardless of your skin color or tone, and whether it’s sunny or cloudy outside. Regularly wearing protection from the sun’s rays will, over time, help reduce the appearance of previous damage while also decreasing your chances of developing skin cancer and further problems.

20,"How-Workplace-Stress-Hurts-the-Bottom","How Workplace Stress Hurts the Bottom Line","Workplace stress is a <a href=""https://eheintl.com/symptoms-of-stress/"">huge problem</a> for employees and companies alike. According to researchers, it costs U.S. businesses as much as $407 billion per year, and is a <a href=""https://news.uci.edu/health/uci-suny-research-details-how-workplace-stress-contributes-to-cardiovascular-disease/"">major contributor to cardiovascular disease</a>. This is a staggering health and financial crisis. At least half of all workers are believed to suffer from stress and tension, and 66 percent of all employees report that their work performance suffers as a result. Poorly managed stress is the main cause of long-term employee absenteeism, and medical experts say that unmanaged stress is the primary cause of illnesses representing up to 70 percent of visits to primary care physicians.

Research shows that chronic stress harms cognitive function and creativity, problem solving skills, decision making, motivation, planning, the ability to effectively strategize, morale, retention, and revenue. Chronic stress undermines employee wellbeing on multiple levels, as well as any company goal that depends on a healthy workforce. Clearly, <a href=""https://eheintl.com/symptoms-of-stress/"">stress management</a> should be an essential component to any company’s employee health care program. The long-term costs in terms of medical bills, interpersonal conflict, errors, and absenteeism are far more financially draining to businesses than the cost of good <a href=""http://www.worktolive.info/stress-management"">stress management</a> and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/Features/PreventionStrategy/"">preventative health care programs</a>.

<strong>Workplace Stress is Contagious</strong>

Humans are intrinsically social, and we mirror one another’s moods and emotions. Therefore, stress symptoms spread among people who work closely together. Employees are also impacted by the stress levels of disgruntled supervisors, management personnel, and their organizing teams. The dynamics of employees’ various office interactions and interpersonal relationships all have a direct bearing on their stress levels.

<strong>Employee Wellbeing Means More Than Physical Health</strong>

Maintaining good health requires attention to nutrition and exercise, of course, but physical care alone is insufficient in ensuring overall wellbeing. The management of workplace stress is essential to preventing chronic illness. Ample <a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1084.html"">research</a> shows that when employees experience stress from work, financial, or family concerns, their health suffers and productivity declines.

<strong>What is the Cost of Workplace Stress?</strong>

Health management company <a href=""http://staywell.com/"">StayWell</a> evaluated the costs of stress, comparing them to those associated with 10 other common health-risk factors. The analysis determined that while obesity, tobacco use, alcohol dependency, high cholesterol, and hypertension comprised 25 percent of companies’ overall healthcare expenditures, stress was the single most costly risk to both employees’ health and an employer’s bottom line.

<strong>How and Why Does Workplace Stress Cause Illness?</strong>

When the brain detects stress, its fight or flight response is activated. Heightened levels of stress hormones – cortisol and norepinephrine – are released into the bloodstream. Over time, if this response becomes chronic, the body will start responding with symptoms linked to a person’s particular physical vulnerabilities. Some individuals will have panic attacks; others may begin having migraines, cardiovascular issues, or problems regulating blood sugar. Stress reactions can also be behavioral: poor eating habits, reliance on tobacco, or alcohol dependency and drug abuse can be responses to chronic stress as well.

<strong>Ideas and Solutions for Workplace Stress Management</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Provide low cost yoga, tai chi, and/or gym memberships for employees</li>
 	<li>Allow employees the option of working from home one day per week</li>
 	<li>Offer meditation classes</li>
 	<li>Encourage a one hour lunch break taken away from the office, or at least a full half-hour break</li>
 	<li>Replace vending machine junk food with healthy snacks and pure water</li>
 	<li>Encourage breaks away from the desk - particularly when stress hits</li>
 	<li>Organize meetings outside when possible</li>
 	<li>Invest in stress management and preventative health care programs for employees</li>
</ul>
American work culture has become increasingly stressful in recent decades. Our healthcare system sometimes neglects the impact of psychological factors and how they influence our overall health. In order to prevent and manage chronic illnesses, thereby lowering healthcare costs, it is essential to create office environments that offer workplace stress relief and management to employees.

21,"The-Benefits-of-Meditation-Are-Amazin","The Benefits of Meditation Are Amazing","Science is proving what many have known for centuries: the benefits of meditation <a href=""https://eheintl.com/health_benefits_of_meditation/"">are exciting and profound</a>. There are countless ways to meditate and innumerable advantages. Discover what works for you by <a href=""https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-11317/11-easy-ways-to-meditate-even-if-it-seems-impossible.html"">exploring different approaches</a>, and then be sure to invest the time in making it a routine part of your life.

A regular meditation practice enhances creativity and productivity at work, and it improves long-term health outcomes in a variety of areas. As little as five minutes of meditation a day can quickly reduce stress and anxiety. But the benefits of meditation go beyond that. Spending 20 minutes to an hour each day meditating (even for just a few weeks) is scientifically demonstrated to:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Increase and enhance the body’s immune response</strong>.</li>
</ul>
Researchers from Harvard Medical School have shown that subjects who practice <a href=""http://www.yogajournal.com/meditation"">yoga and meditation</a> have improved mitochondrial energy production and function, which results in increased immunity and resilience against stress.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Improve cognitive function and focus</strong>.</li>
</ul>
In a study conducted at the University of California, meditators showed a sharp increase in their ability to focus, particularly on boring or repetitive tasks. Subjects also improved their performance in tests of cognitive skill and information processing, and in some cases demonstrated ten times the ability of the non-meditating group. There is also <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/"">evidence</a> that regular meditators develop a thicker prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula, and that a consistent meditation practice can offset <a href=""https://eheintl.com/how_do_i_prevent_cognitive_impairment_and_dementia/"">cognitive decline in old age</a>.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Prevent and reduce addictive behaviors and emotional eating patterns</strong>.</li>
</ul>
Scientists have found that meditation reduces emotional eating, and increased mindfulness generally helps us avoid unhealthy indulgences. A healthy diet is a cornerstone of any good preventative health care plan, and the benefits of meditation include the facilitation of positive habits in this regard.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Decrease anxiety, mood disorders, and depression</strong>.</li>
</ul>
In a <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130315095916.htm"">study</a> conducted in Belgium with 400 students ranging from 13 to 20 years old, an in-school mindfulness meditation program decreased incidents of depression, stress, and anxiety. Students were also shown to be less vulnerable to pronounced and major symptoms of depression with regular meditation practice. <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:COTR.0000045557.15923.96"">Another study</a> shows that mindfulness meditation practice helps those with a history of depression to decrease cognitive dysfunction, negative thinking patterns, and rumination.

</ul>
A healthy sense of self-esteem helps us commit to self-care, and make positive choices for ourselves in order to improve our health and our lives: all key components to a sound preventative health care plan. <a href=""https://www.headspace.com/blog/2015/06/09/how-does-meditation-impact-self-esteem/"">Meditation</a> helps us learn to observe and question our thoughts as they arise. Instead of being swept up in an internal mental narrative, particularly a negative or overly critical one, we learn to create space around our thoughts and emotions in order to examine them. We also learn to release thoughts which harm us or hinder our sense of intrinsic self-worth. Authentic self-esteem is supported by an understanding of our inherent value and worth, and this is a sense of self we don’t have to prove. <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ed-and-deb-shapiro/meditation-self-esteem_b_1803862.html"">Mindfulness</a> meditation is a powerful way to improve self-esteem, and as a result we tend to make healthier and more compassionate choices for ourselves.

<strong>Popular Meditation Styles</strong><strong> </strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Mindfulness Meditation </strong>– This technique aims to create a non-judgmental and relaxed ability to observe thoughts, sensations, and emotions as they arise on a moment by moment basis. The technique is as simple as setting aside time each day to sit, focus on deep belly breathing, and experience these internal events as they unfold. Mindfulness trains us to declutter the mind, and become more present and observant of the world around us. Instead of operating on auto-pilot, we learn to pay attention in each moment of our lives.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Apps for Mindfulness Meditation Training</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Headspace</strong> - A great app for people learning meditation for the first time, <a href=""https://www.headspace.com/"">Headspace</a> offers 10 free beginner-focused, mindfulness meditation sessions of 10 minutes apiece.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Transcendental Meditation </strong>– This technique is taught for a fee by a certified teacher. <a href=""http://www.tm.org/"">Transcendental Meditation</a> is a silent mantra style of meditation which does not involve the self-monitoring of mindfulness techniques. TM is considered helpful as a way to increase relaxation, stress relief, and personal development.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vipassana Meditation</strong> – This technique is one of the most ancient, and has been taught in India for more than 2500 years. <a href=""https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index"">Vipassana</a> is taught free of charge by trained instructors, with donations requested as able, during 10-day training sessions around the world. This training involves mental focus on the breath while contemplating the nature of impermanence, or change, in order to generate greater peace and self-understanding.</li>
</ul>
Regardless of the meditation style you choose, consistency is key. In order to reap the myriad benefits of meditation, it is important to establish a regular practice. The more we meditate, the better we will feel. Meditation makes individuals happier, physically and mentally healthier, and better equipped to deal with stress. The benefits of meditation can no longer be ignored.

23,"This-Recipe-for-Salmon-Burgers-Is-Eas","This Recipe for Salmon Burgers Is Easy and Perfect","Summertime usually means lots of barbecues - typically filled with hot dogs, greasy chips, and burgers doused in cheese and mayonnaise. We've created this salmon burgers recipe as the perfect alternative to the standard barbecue menu. The salmon is juicy, flavorful and accompanied by a garlicky, creamy sauce. You won't miss any of the classic treats once you try this salmon burgers recipe, <a href=""https://eheintl.com/becoming-secret-chef/"">a fun way to get some great nutrition</a>.

<strong>Eat Salmon Burgers for DHA and EHA Content</strong>

We often hear that we should be eating more fish, but few of us actually get the 2-3 weekly servings recommended. We love these salmon burgers because you can easily freeze the patties and pop them into a pan for a quick dinner. Eating salmon adds a healthy dose of protein, which is the building block of our muscles and hormones. It also helps keep us satiated for longer. The fish is full of micronutrients like B vitamins and potassium. Most importantly, <a href=""https://authoritynutrition.com/11-benefits-of-salmon/"">salmon is an excellent source of Omega-3s</a>, which are typically under-consumed in the modern American diet.

The Omega-3s found in salmon (and other oily fishes) are called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). You've probably seen supplements with these two names advertised - and for good reason, as they contribute to many functions throughout our body. Cultures in which the cuisine features regular fish consumption tend to have significantly lower rates of heart disease and high blood pressure. EHA and DHA are also crucial for brain function - improving memory, preventing depression, and lowering the risk for Alzheimer's disease.

<strong>Choose Healthier Bread Products</strong>

Traditional wheat products like white flour and breadcrumbs can trigger weight gain, blood sugar issues and inflammation throughout the body. For this salmon burger recipe, we've replaced breadcrumbs with almond flour, which is made by grinding almonds into a powder. Almonds add heart-healthy fats and additional protein as well. We've also suggested choosing sprouted or gluten-free buns. Sprouted wheat is healthier than whole wheat because it is more digestible. All grains contain phytic acid, which protects the plant but also inhibits our ability to absorb the nutrients. Sprouted bread products are less processed, so they also retain more of their nutrients. If you want an even lighter option, these patties are just as delicious served in a lettuce wrap.

<em>For serving:</em>
<ul>

<strong>Step 2:</strong> Remove skin from the salmon and cut into smaller chunks. Peel the onion and cut in half, setting one half aside. Cut jalapeño in half lengthwise and remove seeds, setting one half aside. Add all burger ingredients to a food processor and pulse until fully minced and combined.

24,"The-Work-Life-Balance-is-a-Skill-You-","The Work / Life Balance is a Skill You Need to Pursue","Many people find the work-life balance challenging to navigate. In addition to heavy workloads we have families, friends, self-care, and personal interests to attend to, all of which are important to our overall happiness and well-being. Often, we are met with overwhelming demands in multiple areas of our lives, and it can be difficult to develop a strategy for balancing the various responsibilities we face. Once we are chronically overloaded our stress hormone levels spike, productivity and relationships suffer, and we become more vulnerable to lowered immunity and illness. With some structure and a bit of strategy, however, we can learn to <a href=""https://eheintl.com/manage_your_stress_with_these_techniques/"">manage stress</a>, and achieve better balance and quality of life.

<strong>Strategies for Work</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Boundaries: </strong>If you are in the habit of taking on every responsibility and project that comes your way it might be time to learn the art of saying no. Be realistic about how much you can take on at a given time. Depending on your profession, you may have more or less control over your workload, but wherever you do have a say, you can learn to draw a line when you need to. Learn to say no.</li>
 	<li><strong>Work from Home: </strong>Again, this is profession specific, but whenever possible ask for flexibility with your schedule. Even telecommuting one day a week from home can help alleviate stress. Many companies are becoming savvy to the importance of work / life balance, and are adopting policies to <a href=""https://eheintl.com/preventing-workplace-stress/"">prevent workplace stress</a>, so find out what your options are.</li>
 	<li><strong>Take Breaks: </strong>Breaks are necessary throughout the day, and you are entitled to take a pause when needed. When you start to feel fatigued, frustrated, or overwhelmed, get up from your desk, take a walk, get some fresh air, and engage some <a href=""https://www.stress.org/take-a-deep-breath/"">deep breathing</a> to reset. Apps like <a href=""http://www.accupedo.com/"">Accupedo</a> can motivate you to track your daily activity and stay active.</li>
 	<li><strong>Set Reasonable Expectations: </strong>Perfectionism in work and in life is linked to chronic stress and illness, so go a little easy on yourself. Bring your best to what you do, but understand that mistakes, or a less than perfect job performance at times, are normal. Remember that performance tends to suffer when we are pushed past capacity, so delegate where and when you can, and ask for help when you need it.</li>
 	<li><strong>Draft a Daily To-Do List: </strong>Set manageable goals each day and keep track of them. By drawing up a daily list of priorities and tasks to achieve, and staying on top of them as you complete them one by one, you will feel a sense of mastery over your workload which reduces stress and the feeling of being overwhelmed.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Strategies for Home</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Practice Self-Care: </strong>Identify what you need to feel your best, be healthy, and regulate when you are stressed and upset. Self-care is for you: the more you are able to reset your energy and cope with stressors, the more you have to give to your relationships and other areas of your life. Exercise, meditation, journaling, listening to music, time alone, walks in nature, avoiding upsetting media during certain times, pursuing hobbies or personal interests, are all examples of ways to practice self-care. Think about the things you enjoy that recharge and help you feel renewed and refreshed on an ongoing basis. Good self-care is something you can learn to weave throughout your daily and weekly schedule. Self-care also makes you more stress resilient overall.</li>
 	<li><strong>Delegate:</strong> Take steps to ensure that responsibilities at home are fairly distributed among household members so that no one person is carrying the majority of the weight. Draw up chore charts and lists, or clearly discuss who will be responsible for what on a daily and / or weekly basis.</li>
 	<li><strong>More Boundaries:</strong> Carve out distraction free time with loved ones. Maybe you decide that work brought home is only done in a designated area (like an office) at set times, but devices and work at the dinner table are off limits. Maybe you commit to dinner as a couple / family four nights a week while leaving the other three open for other work and social commitments. Decide what works for you based on the needs of your household.</li>
 	<li><strong>Eat Well: </strong>Do your best to keep your diet based on whole, fresh, and natural foods, and take the time to eat in a mindful way. Prepare your own meals as much as possible, and avoid stressful conversation at meal times.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cultivate Friendships: </strong><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195151/"">Social support</a> is key to a good work / life balance. Supportive friendships reduce stress, isolation, and strengthen the immune system. Have at least one or two people you can trust and confide in; social support is good for your mental and emotional health, and makes you more stress resilient in all areas of your life.</li>
</ul>
Maybe you have a good balance in some areas of your life, but need to shore up others; perhaps you are starting from scratch. Begin from where you are and know that it is possible to improve no matter how daunting the process may seem. One powerful way to strengthen your work / life balance is to release time wasting activities and relationships. If someone or something is more of an energy and time drain than an asset, assess if you can afford the investment of your precious time. Figure out what your priorities are and make them your main focus.

25,"Benefits-of-a-Physical-Examination-as","Benefits of a Physical Examination as Preventative Health Care","A physical examination is more than a check-up; it’s one of the best ways to boost longevity and health in the long term by committing to preventative care and <a href=""https://eheintl.com/dont-fear-medical-screenings/"">medical screenings</a>. Proactive measures help you and your doctor identify potential health risks, making it easier to avoid and interrupt chronic illness before it takes hold. This is why it is important to see your doctor for <a href=""https://eheintl.com/preventive-exams-not-a-c-suite-luxury/"">annual physical exams</a>.

We know that visiting the doctor is intimidating for many, and we encourage you to confront any fear you may be feeling and make the appointment. Your doctor is a partner in creating good long-term health outcomes, and the peace of mind which comes from taking positive action is worth the nerves and effort.

While overcoming fear of doctor’s visits sounds great in theory, in practice it feels overwhelming for some at first. <a href=""https://eheintl.com/attacking_anxiety_with-actionandawareness/"">Anxiety</a> about medical care is common, and can be difficult to manage at times. When calling to make your medical appointments, it is helpful to communicate your concerns to the individuals responsible for scheduling. Maybe you have a fear of needles, and you want to ensure you are seen by your doctor’s best and most sensitive phlebotomist. By communicating your needs to your care providers, you give them the opportunity to accommodate you and make your visit as comfortable as possible.

<strong>Happy Side Effect of a Physical Examination</strong>

It is important to remember that scheduling an annual physical examination is just one part of making the commitment to self-care and better health choices. Lifestyle habits such as exercise, <a href=""https://eheintl.com/how_to_keep_good_sleep_hygiene/"">proper sleep habits / hygiene</a>, nutrition, stress management, and medical care are all key to supporting your health over time.

As you learn to find ways <a href=""https://eheintl.com/how-to-make-lasting-change/"">to commit to lasting change</a>, you can be sure that your efforts will pay off. Benefits such as better sleep, healthier body weight, increased energy, and better mental clarity result from taking charge of your health and well-being.

<strong>Some Things to Consider Before Your Physical Examination
</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Preventative care will help decrease and ease anxiety over time by protecting your health in the long term.</li>
 	<li>A proactive approach to health care includes developing healthier lifestyle habits such as exercise, sleep hygiene, and stress management which contribute to the prevention of many chronic and degenerative diseases.</li>
 	<li>Preventative medical screenings help protect your financial future. Illness is far less expensive to prevent than it is to treat.</li>
 	<li>Annual medical screenings actually reduce your time spent in the doctor’s office by decreasing the likelihood of more complex illnesses developing over time.</li>
</ul>
<strong> Action Steps: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Choose a type of <a href=""https://eheintl.com/health-benefits-of-exercise-is-a-fountain-of-youth/"">exercise</a> you enjoy, and commit to it at least three times per week.</li>
 	<li>See your doctor regularly for physical exams.</li>
 	<li>Eat a nourishing and balanced diet based in whole, natural, and minimally processed foods.</li>
 	<li>Do not smoke. If you do smoke, talk with your doctor about the right <a href=""https://eheintl.com/quick_thought_smoking_cessation/"">smoking cessation</a> program for you.</li>
 	<li>Drink alcohol in moderation or not at all.</li>
 	<li>Get at least seven to eight hours of sleep each night. Turn off your phone and electronic devices at least one hour before bed, and sleep in a well darkened room.</li>
</ul>
Remember that your health and peace of mind are worth the effort it takes to protect them, so we encourage a proactive approach. Know that any anxiety you may feel about seeing your doctor is understandable, however, over time, a preventative health care approach will decrease health related anxieties, protect your financial future, and increase your wellness and longevity for years to come.

26,"Top-10-Signs-You-Might-Have-Seasonal-","Top 10 Signs You Might Have Seasonal Allergies (and How to Deal with Them)","Seasonal allergies touch the lives of most of us at some point. According to the CDC, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/allergies.htm"">20 million adults in the US have been diagnosed with hay fever in the past 12 months</a>.

Spring seasonal allergies can start as early as February and can last well into the summer. Trees that produce large amounts of pollen are one of the main triggers. A particularly rainy spring or mild winter can cause trees and plants to grow more rapidly, producing larger amounts of pollen and leading to a more severe allergy season. This can also cause an increase in the growth of mold spores which are another major allergen.

<strong>10 Major Symptoms of Seasonal Allergies</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>Coughing</li>
 	<li>Sneezing</li>
 	<li>Nasal congestion or runny nose</li>
 	<li>Postnasal drip</li>
 	<li>Fatigue or low energy</li>
 	<li>Itchy, red or swollen eyes</li>
 	<li>Watery eyes</li>
 	<li>Allergic Shiners (dark circles under the eyes as a result of congestion)</li>
 	<li>Itchy throat or roof of the mouth</li>
 	<li>Rash or itchy skin</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who is Susceptible to Seasonal Allergies?</h3>
Anyone can develop seasonal allergies during various stages of life. A child may grow out of their allergies by adulthood. Allergens triggering major reactions may diminish or increase from season to season. And moving from one climate to another could cause you to develop allergies that perhaps you were never aware of.

<strong>How to Prepare for Seasonal Allergies</strong>

One of the best ways to ease the affect of your seasonal allergies is to keep an eye on <a href=""https://weather.com/forecast/allergy/l/USDC0001:1:US"">the pollen and mold spore counts</a> which are normally announced in newspapers or news broadcasts during the allergy season.

Keep your windows closed during the season and run the air-conditioner during days with particularly high pollen counts. You may also consider a home air filter or air purifier.

<strong>Prevention of Seasonal Allergies</strong>

Allergies are not preventable, but your allergic reactions can be minimized. The best form of prevention is understanding what triggers or causes your allergies. Visiting an allergist can help you determine your triggers and prescribe treatment. An allergist may prescribe medications or help you with advice on avoiding allergens such as remaining in an air-conditioned area during days with particularly high pollen counts.

Seasonal allergies may be something you have to live with over the course of your life, but you don’t have to suffer. By preparing for the season, understanding your triggers, and through the use of medications or avoidance, you can make your seasonal allergies much more bearable.

Tired of staring at the TV while on the elliptical or treadmill? Did you play sports your whole life until the reality of adulthood and a 9 to 5 job brought playing to a grinding halt? If any of these scenarios sound familiar to you, it might be time to shake up your routine and join an adult sports team! Even if you’ve never set foot on a court, field or diamond, if there’s a sport you’ve always wanted to play but never learned, joining an adult sport league can be a great way to learn a new skill, exercise and have fun! If this sounds like something you’d like to try, you most likely have a lot of questions. What sport should you play? Where are you going to find a team? What if you’ve never played before? Read on for some tips on what you could play, where to look and what to expect.

<img class=""size-medium wp-image-3610 alignleft"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Dodgeball-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />

The good news is that depending on where you live and work, there are often quite a few sports and activities to choose from--volleyball, softball, basketball, soccer and even kickball, dodgeball and ultimate frisbee! Start by checking with your local YMCA or your city’s parks and recreation department—they often have leagues already set up. There’s usually a fee to play but it is relatively inexpensive. Another possibility is to ask if your job has any workplace sponsored teams you could join. And if those don’t yield results, do an internet search for phrases like “adult basketball league in (your city)” or “coed softball league in (your city)” as these will often produce good results.

If you’re just a beginner and worried about not being good enough for a team, don’t let that stop you! Some leagues have different levels of play available from beginner to more advanced. My city for example, has beginner, intermediate and advanced divisions in its volleyball league.  Start out in the beginner league and as you improve you can move on to the next level of play. Or start with something that doesn’t require a lot of athletic prowess, like kickball! You can go to <a href=""http://www.kickball.com/searchzip"">WAKA</a> and put in your zip code to see if there are any leagues near you! (I just did it and found 1 locally and 2 others within an hour of my house!)

Although joining a team may sound appealing, you may be wondering if it is really practical. Between work and family obligations who has the time for this? But remember that everyone else is dealing with time constraints too, so you can probably find something that will work with your schedule.

If you’re still not convinced to give it a try, consider these benefits of joining an adult sports league that you may not have considered. You can:

<em>Meet new people and expand your social circle:</em> Joining a team is a great way to meet people and make new friends. You already know you share at least one interest with the other members of your team, so it’s a good way to break the ice and get to know your teammates even better. There’s nothing quite like the camaraderie you build through teamwork on the playing field.

<em>Relieve stress:</em> Playing in a basketball game or a beach volleyball game (or whatever your sport of

choice is!) can be a great way to de-stress and blow off steam after a long day at work. It gives you the opportunity to get away from it all and escape from the routine of the workweek and the worries of daily life. I think we could all use a healthy escape like this from time to time!

<em>Have fun!:</em> The importance of play doesn’t end with childhood. Sometimes we forget this as we grow older. Play bring joy and who doesn’t want more joy in their life? When you’re having fun playing a team sport you are engaged and connected and these feelings can be a tremendous boost to your mental health.

<em>Variety:</em> Going to the gym every day or for a jog is certainly admirable and great for your health, but it’s also good to mix things up once in a while. When you play a team sport you’ll add variety to your workouts, you’ll get a change of scenery and you may have so much fun that you forget you’re exercising!

Of course, you can’t overlook the very important fact that when you are physically active you are healthier. And we are all more likely to be physically active and <em>stay</em> physically active when we enjoy what we are doing! That’s why joining a sports league may be just the thing--not only will you get moving and reap the physical benefits of exercise, you’ll have fun doing it!","2017-05-09 04:00:00","2018-05-09 18:21:36","UBlog_20170510_Image.jpg","image/jpeg",143286,"2018-05-09 18:21:36",NULL
28,"Creating-A-Box-Garden","Creating A Box Garden","The first time I tried a box garden, I wasn't sure what to plant. I decided to go to my local farmers market and told them what my family enjoys eating and asked if any of those vegetables grow well in our area. I was in luck because lettuce, carrots, peppers, radishes, and tomatoes were on the list, and my family loves salad. And bonus, this mix of vegetables plants happens to be easy to care for!  We decided to start with a small box garden to give it a trial run the first year we did it.

From my experience as a beginner box gardener, here are a few tips to get started.
<ul>
 	<li>Box garden, well, in a box! If you don’t want to invest too much time, you can purchase a kit that comes complete with pre-measured and cut lumber and hardware-how handy! Avoid building a boxed garden on a wooden deck as the weight might be too much for the deck to bear. If you build directly on a concrete patio be sure to raise the box garden so there is proper drainage.</li>
 	<li>By design box gardens need little space. Make sure the location you choose will get an appropriate amount of sunlight and is close to a water source. Fill the box garden up to about three inches from the top with a good-quality mix of nutrient-rich soil and compost that is best suited for the plants you want to grow. Make sure it is level and smooth once filled. Keep the soil moist, but be careful not to over-water your garden.</li>
 	<li>Spacing of plants can be closer than a normal garden but don’t overdo it on the seeds. Standard seed packets will have way more than you need as I found out when I used a whole packet of carrot seeds and grew these teeny tiny carrots the size of my pinky. Your first season may be an experiment.</li>
 	<li>Family project. My kids loved running to the garden to snip the lettuce and pull the radishes for the ultimate fresh salad. We were even inspired to make our own fresh dressing (recipe below). Take turns with watering, weeding and harvesting. The pride of gardening is contagious and so is the love of salads. We are eating more salad than ever—even froze some tomatoes for the winter months.</li>
</ul>
Now, to keep the squirrels away!

29,"New-Parents-And-Sleep","New Parents And Sleep","It’s 3 a.m. and your baby is crying again. Does her diaper need changing? Is he hungry? Does she need to be changed <em>and</em> fed?

Unfortunately, interrupted sleep is a fact of life for parents of a newborn which makes those first few months of parenthood utterly and completely exhausting.  It is not at all unusual for new parents to feel sleep deprived and wonder if they will ever get a good night’s sleep again.

While a night of uninterrupted sleep is unlikely those first few months, there are strategies you can use to maximize the amount of rest you do get. Incorporating those strategies can help to alleviate some of the negative health consequences that can occur due to disrupted sleep.

<!--more-->

<strong>Effects of Disrupted Sleep</strong>

This probably comes as no surprise, especially if you are currently in the midst of caring for a newborn…but adequate sleep is a vital component of your health and well–being, and when you don’t sleep well, many important aspects of your life can suffer including your mood, cognitive ability, attention span and energy level.

Numerous studies support this conclusion including a <a href=""http://www.journalsleep.org/ViewAbstract.aspx?pid=30292"">study</a> published in the November 2015 journal <em>Sleep</em> that examined the effects of three different sleep conditions—three consecutive nights of either forced awakenings, delayed bedtimes or uninterrupted sleep--on 62 healthy men and women. Results confirmed the negative consequences interrupted sleep has on your energy level and mood. The study found that after the first night the participants who were subjected to eight forced awakenings and those with delayed bedtimes showed similar low positive mood and high negative mood. After two nights however, the group with forced awakenings had a 31 percent reduction in their positive mood and the group with a delayed bedtime had only a 12 percent reduction in positive mood compared to the first day. Both groups had similar negative moods on all three days. The researchers discovered that the forced awakening group had shorter periods of deep, slow-wave restorative sleep than the group with the delayed bedtime, and the lack of this type of sleep had a statistically significant association with the participant’s reduction in positive mood. They also found that interrupted sleep not only reduced participant’s energy levels, but also reduced their feelings of sympathy and friendliness. Another <a href=""http://www.sleep-journal.com/article/S1389-9457(14)00157-9/abstract"">study</a> conducted on students and published in the July 2014 issue of <em>Sleep Medicine</em>, found a causal link between interrupted sleep patterns and reduced cognitive abilities, shortened attention spans, and negative moods.

<strong>What Can You Do?</strong>

Of course, the joys of new parenthood can go a long way towards making up for the sleep deprivation you feel, but you can also employ some strategies to help mitigate the effects of interrupted sleep. Most parenting experts suggest trying the following:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Sleep when your baby sleeps.</strong> This can’t be emphasized enough! When your baby naps, you nap. When your baby goes to bed at night, it’s time for you to go to bed too. Turn off your phone, computer, and tablet. Leave the dishes in the sink, the laundry in the hamper and any other household chores that aren’t finished for another time. Your sleep is much more important.</li>
 	<li><strong>Split nighttime duties with your partner.</strong> This can be done in several different ways depending on your specific situation. If your baby is bottle fed, divide the night into four hour shifts, so each of you can get four hours of uninterrupted sleep, or alternate entire nights so each of you get a full night of uninterrupted sleep every other night. Another option is simply alternating who feeds and changes the baby each time the baby awakens. (You can even sleep in separate rooms during this time so the parent that is “off-duty” can get undisturbed sleep.) If the baby is breast fed, nursing mothers could pump a bottle of breast milk in advance so her partner can take a turn feeding the baby at night. If pumping breast milk is not an option, the partner can bring the baby to the breastfeeding mom and handle nighttime diaper changes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keep your room quiet, dark, and unstimulating.</strong> For overnight feedings and diaper changes, keep lighting as low as possible using a night light with low illumination, and keep distractions to a minimum.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ask for and accept help:</strong> If any trust worthy adult in your life asks if you need any help, say yes! Have them spend time with the baby while you take a nap. Or, if your family members or friends want to visit say yes and ask them to let you take a nap to recharge.</li>
 	<li><strong>Remember there is a light at the end of the tunnel:</strong> Although you may feel like you’ll never get a good night’s sleep again, remember that this too shall pass. Babies generally start sleeping for longer, more humane stretches of time by 3 to 6 months of age.</li>
</ul>
Being a new parent has many highs and lows—it is a joyful time and an exhausting time as well. While sleep deprivation is almost guaranteed in the first few months of your baby’s life, it is also possible to get some relief. Try some--or better yet all--of the strategies above to maximize the amount of rest you do get. Remember that a fundamental aspect of being a good parent is taking good care of yourself so you can take good care of your family!","2017-02-28 05:00:00","2018-05-09 18:21:46","Screen-Shot-2017-07-20-at-12.04.39-PM.png","image/png",976130,"2018-05-09 18:21:45",NULL
30,"Accepting-the-Challenge-with-Wearable","Accepting the Challenge with Wearables","Wearable technology (or “wearables”) have exploded onto the scene and have become the must have item for the holidays. Whether you’re rocking a Fitbit wristband or an Apple Watch, wearables have become a symbol of cool. But when used properly they can also symbolize good health.

The selling point for wearables is in the trackers, or put another way in gathering data on particular health metrics. These devices are commonly used to track things such as steps, calories burned, heart rate, and even sleep hours. And when users log-in to their wearables’ website they can view this data on their dashboard. It’s almost like opening up the menu in a video game and viewing your character’s stats, but instead of leveling up in the virtual world you do so in the real one. Pretty cool!

However, getting these stats don’t come cheap as this technology is essentially asking people to do what research has been telling them to do for years, which is to eat right and exercise. With that said, wearables have changed the conversation from a lecture to more of a challenge.

Wellness programs within organizations have been getting a big push in the last decade as “<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2862441/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">lifestyle diseases</a>” have become an overwhelming burden being responsible for 7 out of every 10 deaths annually and accounting for 86 percent of healthcare costs, according to the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. And since incentives seem to be the way to go for organizations to promote wellness, tracking health metrics through a popular gizmo is just the medium to achieve this goal.

<img class=""alignright wp-image-1744"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/smart_watch_20151222.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth208ampnamesmart_watch_20151222.jpg"" alt=""smart_watch"" width=""320"" height=""320"" />But employees win out too as health challenges issued by the organization (e.g., to reach 10,000 daily for a month) allows employees to get creative to meet these goals and gives them the impetus to create their own challenges. Now when individuals go to work and see their co-workers rocking wearables a bond is formed as the shared experience of working towards a health goal creates a sense of unity and belonging. Wearables then become a source of pride, but only as far as the motivation to meet health goals is present.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
Wearables are uniquely placed in an area where health promotion is needed in an accessible format. However, novelty is short-lived where lasting change isn’t. In order for individuals and organizations to get the most out of wearables both must rise to the challenge of leveling up their health.

Seemingly slight differences in structure translate into crucial differences in form and function.”
<!--more--></span>
<h3>Types of Dietary Fat</h3>
There are three main types of dietary fat: unsaturated, saturated, and trans.

<strong>Unsaturated Fats: </strong> Often referred to as the “good” fats, unsaturated fats are either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. According to the <a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good"">Harvard Medical School</a>, unsaturated fats are usually liquid at room temperature and are found mainly in plant–based sources. Polyunsaturated fats are referred to as essential fats because the body requires them for good health but cannot synthesize them on its own, so they must be obtained from food.

Unsaturated fats can be found in olive, peanut, sunflower, corn, soybean, and flaxseed oils; avocados; nuts; seeds; and fish. Unsaturated fats are considered to be beneficial because they may help improve and maintain blood cholesterol levels, reduce blood pressure, ease inflammation, and stabilize heart rhythms.

<strong>Saturated Fats: </strong> According to the <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyEating/Saturated-Fats_UCM_301110_Article.jsp"">American Heart Association (AHA)</a>, “From a chemical standpoint, saturated fats are simply fat molecules that have no double bonds between carbon molecules because they are saturated with hydrogen molecules.”

These fats can be found in red meat, butter, whole milk, dairy products made with whole or 2 percent milk, cheeses, palm and coconut oils, and many commercially prepared baked goods and fried foods.

Interestingly, recent research has called the association between saturated fats and cardiovascular disease into question. A <a href=""http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1846638"">systematic review and meta-analysis</a> examining the association between dietary fatty acids and coronary heart disease (CHD) published in the March 18, 2014 <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>, concluded that, “Current evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total saturated fats.” A <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/91/3/535.full"">meta-analysis</a> of 21 studies that appeared in the March 2010 issue of <i>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i> found that there was not enough evidence to conclude that saturated fat increases the risk of CHD or cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Despite this conflicting evidence, the <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Cholesterol/PreventionTreatmentofHighCholesterol/Know-Your-Fats_UCM_305628_Article.jsp#.VnmIsPkrJMw"">AHA</a> recommends limiting saturated fats to less than 7 percent of one’s total daily calories because “Decades of sound science has proven it can raise your “bad” cholesterol and put you at higher risk for heart disease.”

<strong>Trans Fats: </strong> There are two types of trans fats in the diet: those formed naturally and those created during food processing.

Those formed naturally are produced in the gut of some grazing animals. According to the <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Cholesterol/PreventionTreatmentofHighCholesterol/Know-Your-Fats_UCM_305628_Article.jsp"">AHA</a>, trans fats that are created during processing (also called “partially hydrogenated oils”) “are created in an industrial process that adds hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid.”

The primary source of trans fats in the American diet are foods containing industrially–modified and partially–hydrogenated vegetable oils such as fried foods, pizza dough, pie crust, margarine, chips, and commercially baked goods such as pastries, cookies, doughnuts, and crackers.

Artificial trans fats are harmful because they raise bad (LDL) cholesterol levels and lower good (HDL) cholesterol levels, which are risk factors for heart disease. The AHA recommends limiting artificial trans fats to less than one percent of total daily calories.
<h3>Benefits of Fats</h3>
Although the excessive consumption of some fats can cause serious health issues, individuals should not cut out fats altogether because fats are essential to health. In addition to providing the body with energy, fats serve many other important functions; according to <a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good"">Harvard Medical School</a>, fats aid in:
<ul>
 	<li>The absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K as well as carotenoids</li>
 	<li>Blood clotting</li>
 	<li>Muscle movement</li>
 	<li>Inflammation</li>
 	<li>Building cell membranes</li>
 	<li>Building the sheaths that surround nerves</li>
</ul>
It is important to keep in mind that all fats are very high in calories and therefore must be eaten in moderation as part of an overall well–balanced diet. Unfortunately, according to the <a href=""https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/""><i>Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2015</i></a>, the diets of most Americans contain far more fat than the body needs. The consistent consumption of excessive fat, particularly excessive amounts of the wrong types of fat, can lead to serious health complications. It is important for you to be aware of the fat content of the foods you consume and try to replace most saturated and trans fats with healthier unsaturated fats because these types of fats will help promote your health and well-being.","2016-11-01 04:00:00","2018-05-09 18:21:54","blog-news-20161102-1.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth508ampnameblog-news-20161102-1.jpg","image/jpeg",101835,"2018-05-09 18:21:54",NULL
32,"Digestive-Health","Digestive Health","<em>In the “Maintaining Health” series it was established that what you put inside your body determines, more than any other component, the trajectory of your health. This series, titled “Digestive Health,” will help you discover how food and drink is broken down; why the kinds of food that you ingest affect your digestion and consequently your health; and what you can do to keep your digestive system in optimal working condition.</em>
<h3><strong>
Digestive Health: An Introduction to Digestion</strong></h3>
Digestion is like breathing: it’s an important, automatic bodily process that isn’t given a second thought unless something goes wrong; but unlike breathing, digestion is complex and requires consistent maintenance.

This article will inform readers what the digestive system is and how it works so they can begin to have a deeper understanding of its significance.
<h3><strong>What is the Digestive System?</strong></h3>
According to the <a href=""http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Anatomy/your-digestive-system/Documents/Digestive_System_508.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDKD)</a>, “The digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract—also called the digestive tract—and the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder.” It is made up of hollow organs and solid organs. The hollow organs are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines. The solid organs include the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. Together the components of the digestive system utilize muscle movements, digestive juices, enzymes, and bacteria to break down, extract, and distribute the nutrition present in foods and drink.
<h3><strong>Digestion in Action</strong></h3>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-1532"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ThinkstockPhotos-475549977.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth200ampnameThinkstockPhotos-475549977.jpg"" alt=""Digestion in Action"" width=""361"" height=""481"" />Digestion first begins in the mouth, a hollow organ that leads to the esophagus. The mouth uses mastication (chewing) in order to break down foods into smaller bits. While chewing is taking place, saliva is secreted by the salivary glands in the mouth to break down complex carbohydrates as well as to moisten the food bits so that they may be swallowed.

Swallowing is performed by the esophagus, a hollow organ which leads to the stomach. Food that is swallowed is involuntarily pushed by the muscles in the esophagus towards the lower esophageal sphincter (the muscle that controls what goes into the stomach) in a process called esophageal peristalsis.

Food passes through the esophageal sphincter and enters the stomach, a hollow organ that leads to the duodenum of the small intestine. Here, food is mixed with hydrochloric acid (to further break down food bits) and proteases (an enzyme secreted by the pancreas that turns proteins into amino acids). The stomach is lined with muscles that churn this mixture (via peristalsis) into chime--a mass of partly digested food.

Chyme enters the duodenum of the small intestine to be further broken down. Digestive juices from the small intestine and pancreas combined with bile from the liver allow the food to be absorbed into the blood where it can be distributed throughout the body. Chyme that wasn’t fully digested for whatever reason is sent to the large intestine.

The large intestine receives waste products and anything else that wasn’t fully digested in the small intestine. It absorbs any remaining water and nutrients before turning the waste into stool, where it is stored in the rectum (as part of the large intestine) to be discharged via defecation.
<div>
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
The digestive process utilizes many components of the body in order to turn food and drink into nourishment. Though as with any process with moving parts, it is subject to malfunction if routine maintenance isn’t upheld. In the next entry in the “Digestive Health” series, we will take a closer look at the components of digestion in order to keep your digestive system running at peak performance.

Utilizing heartwarming photos, the window display at 10 Rockefeller Center in the Today Show Plaza between West 48th Street and West 49th Street will showcase the real life stories of children who have received special wishes through the efforts of the Foundation. In addition to information about the nonprofit’s mission, there will be a viewing screen in the center of the display with slides of many wish recipients, as well as the man who started it all, Marty Lyons, in action from his days as a star football player with the New York Jets.

“The window display at Rockefeller Center will be a magnificent and powerful communications vehicle for relating our mission to the public. We are very grateful to EHE International for the opportunity to showcase the good works of our Foundation. Spreading joy and creating important memories throughout our 10 chapters in 13 states is a rewarding experience for me, staff members, volunteers and our generous supporters. This window display in the heart of New York City will show the public what the Foundation is about and give them a glimpse of many of the bright moments in the lives of our wish children,” said Lyons.

EHE International has been a leader in preventive care and wellness services for over 100 years. “EHE International is proud to support the Marty Lyons Foundation through this donation of our window. The display will create awareness of the Foundation’s dedicated efforts to grant wishes for children and families facing unimaginable hardship,” said Deborah McKeever, President of EHE International.

34,"EHE-Showcases-The-Stand-Up-To-Cancer-","EHE Showcases The Stand Up To Cancer Campaign to Encourage and Support Cancer Research Funding","NEW YORK, NY (April 1, 2016) − A Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C) window display at Rockefeller Plaza will reach nearly 250,000 people per day to take action in the fight against cancer for the month of April. Featuring Academy Award-Winner Eddie Redmayne, the display is adapted from a public service announcement (PSA) by Stand Up To Cancer, a program of the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) and a 501 (c)(3) organization that, “raise funds to accelerate the pace of groundbreaking translational research that can get new therapies to patients quickly and save lives now.”

<!--more-->

The SU2C display shows Redmayne running head-on toward the viewer in the visual style of an action film while bold text reiterates the fact that more than 1,600 people in the U.S. die each day from cancer. That sobering statistic and the dynamic image together convey the urgency of getting new, more effective therapies to patients who desperately need them. SU2C facilitates collaboration by “Dream Teams” of leading scientists who work together to translate advances in the laboratory into new treatments for patients at an accelerated pace. Since Stand Up To Cancer was launched in 2008, more than 1,100 scientists from over 130 institutions around the world have collaborated through SU2C.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

“This is an incredibly promising moment in cancer research, but we risk losing that momentum if we don’t act now to support the scientists on the front lines of this fight and their life-saving work,” said EIF President and SU2C Co-founder Lisa Paulsen. “We’re so grateful to EHE International for the opportunity to share that message with the millions of people who will pass by this display.”

“EHE International is proud to be a longtime supporter of Stand Up To Cancer’s impressive campaign,” said Deborah McKeever, president of EHE International.

The window space at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, donated by EHE International, will house the display throughout the month of April. The display was created as part of SU2C’s Act Now, Save Lives, Stand Up To Cancer campaign, which is an exclusive short film and set of photographs shot by renowned photographer and film director Greg Williams. The campaign features Eva Mendes, Tom Hardy, Idris Elba, Benedict Cumberbatch and Michelle Dockery, among others, in addition to Redmayne.

35,"Attacking-Anxiety-with-Action-and-Awa","Attacking Anxiety with Action and Awareness","The causes of anxiety disorders are not fully known, however, scientists believe that they are most likely the result of a combination of factors including changes in the brain, environmental stress, genetics, and psychological and developmental factors.

Anxiety can also manifest due to medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism, heart failure or COPD, and the use of certain medications or drugs such as corticosteroids, cocaine, amphetamines, and excessive amounts of caffeine.

Since the causes are varied in nature, but the end result (that of anxiousness) is still the same, the only way to treat anxiety disorders—without medication—appears to be to discover a pattern for symptoms and to try and then isolate triggers. This allows an individual to at the very least avoid a possible anxious situation. But avoidance is only half of the answer.

While an anxiety disorder may not have a cure to the extent that the person afflicted will never have to go through extreme anxiety, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t a way to satisfactorily overcome the disorder. Once an individual knows what causes the anxiety to flare up they can preempt the negative experience by modifying their attitude and behavior going in to the situation as opposed to just reacting to it. For example, if a cramped space like a subway car or an elevator causes you anxiety, embrace the time spent in this triggering space by normalizing the area. This can be achieved by being mindful of your breathing, speaking to a stranger with a prepared, friendly greeting, or opening up your posture and putting a smile on your face to invite positivity. In the end mindfulness is key to overcoming social anxiety.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
Social anxiety in an age of virtual worlds, ever distancing relationships, and instant gratification is becoming a big problem. Because anxiety disorders cause extreme discomfort in the individual, escapism is one of the easiest solutions to employ—particularly because one can escape by simply taking out their phone. But the only way to overcome anxiety is to face it with the knowledge of one’s self. The mind is malleable and, if you suffer from an anxiety disorder, this fact along with the idea that the avoidance of anxiety inducing situations can only take you so far should help motivate you to kick anxiety to the curb.

36,"Is-Fitness-Simply-Based-on-Genetics","Is Fitness Simply Based on Genetics?","While the path to physical fitness is straightforward (i.e., dieting and exercise), this path starts to meander wildly when people attempt to actually follow it--lengthening the time it takes to reach the finish line, if ever. The question, of course, becomes ""why?""

Why are people hard-pressed to achieve fitness when every voice out there is saying that it's good? Not only that, but it is equally ubiquitous to hear that not being fit is bad. So why?

An <a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/are-you-programmed-to-enjoy-exercise/?ref=health"">article</a> in the NY Times poses an interesting answer: perhaps unfit people are simply not programmed to be fit.
Citing a study published in

the Journal of Physiology, the article summarizes the study by describing the findings. Essentially, rats that like to run on a wheel were bred with other rats that like to run on a wheel and they in turn produced rats that also like to run on a wheel. The opposite was true for rats that were not so inclined to run.

This difference in the rats is attributed to genes encouraging certain neurons in the brains of running rats to mature and develop the drive to run. The rats that weren't inclined to run showed considerably less mature neurons in their brains. But before we put down the dumbbell in nihilistic fashion, the study also showed that even some non-running rats ran reluctantly.

The professor that oversaw this study cautions that these findings shouldn't be attributed to people as the brains of rats and humans are different, and that ""people can decide to exercise"".

37,"Knowing-Your-Healthy-Self-in-2016","Knowing Your Healthy Self in 2016","Living a healthy life is big on everyone’s radar from getting more sleep, to eating a nutritious diet, and doing enough exercise. But the New Year’s resolution trial period always seems to end at around two weeks. So this post will offer some tips on how to stay in the game for all four quarters and reap the rewards of finishing off a year in the ascension.
<h3>Planning to Suceed</h3>
One of the first things that individuals should do for a healthy life is plan for it. And while making a to-do list is nice and all, it doesn’t always get it done when it’s time. No, a real plan involves knowing what is holding you back from your health goals at the start and having things in place that keep you going when times get rough.

An easy and common obstacle that many people fail to overcome is holiday get-togethers. While Thanksgiving and Christmas are far off, they will inevitably come around meaning that the reverie that prevails with being around family, friends, and food will block out a lot of the discipline that it takes to remain focused on health. Massive amounts of sodium, calories, alcohol, and other things will be consumed by many who feel entitled to being unhealthy, but that shouldn’t be you…and it won’t if you plan.
<h3>Don't Undervalue the Short Game</h3>
Looking ahead is a way for adults to put themselves in a favorable position. In fact, those who fail or simply don’t bother to look ahead are generally criticized as needing to mature. But to get to tomorrow you must live today.

Any change takes time to make into a habit, and with health it takes even longer to see positive outcomes. Instead of giving up or tapering off after an unknown time, individuals should focus their New Year’s health-related resolutions on the day-to-day. If you’ve made a plan to get healthy and know what it takes then completing those objectives everyday will ensure that you get to the end of the year with progress made.
<h3>Mindset Determines Trajectory</h3>
The biggest pitfall for New Year’s health-related resolutions is the reward aspect. Many people feel like they should reward themselves for doing good. This is an extremely slippery slope as once unhealthy habits—habits that have been formed for years—start gaining acceptance, whether it’s once a year, once a month, or once a day then the doors are open for it to become part of one’s lifestyle. The sacrifice of going without and knowing that the change has lasted one more day should be the reward, and while it is excruciating at first, the longer an individual delays gratification the more likely that delay becomes the reward in and of itself.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
As the song in the musical goes, “Change never comes easy.” New Year’s resolutions have been broken by so many people so many times that it has become a farce. This is unacceptable as a resolution requires resolve. If your resolution this year is to live a healthy lifestyle then you must plan ahead, live day-to-day, and let the work you put towards your goals be its own reward.

38,"Food-SubstitutionOne-Thing-Leads-to-A","Food Substitution: One Thing Leads to Another","Back in June of this year, the Journal of the American Medical Association released some <a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2338262"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">interesting news</a>: The <em>2015 Dietary Guidelines</em> would lift the ban on dietary fat—previously the recommendation was to have no more than 35 percent of calories in one’s diet coming from fat.

This change comes partially from the behavior of substitution and how simplifying problems typically lead to more problems with greater complexity.

According to the article, since “fat contains about twice the calories per gram as carbohydrate or protein, it was also reasoned that low-fat diets would help prevent obesity, a growing public health concern.”

So to challenge obesity, low-fat and low-calorie products became the norm; however, these products substituted dietary fat for refined calories and added sugar.

Substituted things are typically not of the same quality as the thing they are substituting, and such is the case with products that tried to substitute fat. Rather than lowering obesity and the risk for cardiovascular disease, low-fat products ironically increased these numbers because everything boiled down to getting total fat to zero on the nutrition label.

Obesity is a complex problem that has numerous causes working with each other to create the epidemic that still continues to this day. Even if an individual were to eat what is considered a healthy diet, this by itself won’t change everything. Indeed, those who go from one unhealthy practice to a healthy one might substitute another unhealthy practice for the one that they gave up, yet the substituted practice is actually worse than the one before it.

<img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-1592"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/donuts_substitution_20151230.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth215ampnamedonuts_substitution_20151230.jpg"" alt=""donuts_substitution"" width=""300"" height=""352"" />For example, a person decides to substitute cakes and other desserts with fruit in an effort to curb added sugars and fat. But because there is a void in this person’s sweet tooth rather than eat sugar he/she will drink them instead as his/her consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages rise. This makes the problem worse because now the individual is actually consuming more added sugar than before, but considers it to be ok because he/she has stopped eating desserts.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
When it comes to your health there is no substitution. Processed and refined foods will always take a back seat to those that are unprocessed and unrefined, such as whole fruits, vegetables, and grains.

39,"The-Prescribed-Painkiller-Problem-in-","The Prescribed Painkiller Problem in the U.S.","People suffer from many issues, from psychological, to emotional, and of course physical, but dealing with these issues sometimes compound the problem rather than alleviating it; for instance, painkillers are commonly prescribed for those who are in pain, however, many prescribed painkillers (such as Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet, and their generic incarnations/derivatives) contain the inherent risk of dependence, whether it stems from a psychological dependence from being prescribed this medicine for a particular issue, an emotional dependence from the thought of having to deal with life without the effects of the drug, or a physical dependence from the drug’s active ingredient.

A person’s pain threshold varies, not to mention it is impossible to measure pain outside of an individual asking the person suffering of the intensity of the sensation on a scale of 1 to 10—so prescribing pain medicine is a tricky situation. Nevertheless, the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> states that: “The United States is in the midst of a prescription painkiller overdose epidemic.” And while the amount of prescribed painkillers has quadrupled since 1999, there “has not been an overall change in the amount of pain that Americans report.”
<h3>The Physicians are Prescribing, which means…?</h3>
<img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-1677"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/painkiller_vert_20151215.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth200ampnamepainkiller_vert_20151215.jpg"" alt=""painkiller_vert"" width=""353"" height=""485"" />According to a recent <a href=""https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_156209.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">MedlinePlus</a> article, primary care doctors are the leading prescribers of narcotic painkillers with 28.1 million prescriptions being issued in 2013, data which was gathered by looking at “Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage claims.” Additionally, nurse practitioners and physician assistants issued 7.2 million prescriptions in their own right.

With these figures in mind, it comes as no surprise that the CDC reports that: “Every day, 44 people in the U.S. die from overdose of prescription painkillers, and many more become addicted.”

So what is being done? What can be done? The article concludes by saying education in better prescription practices, increased oversight on healthcare providers, greater community awareness, and a willingness from both sides to curb habit-forming treatment as being the keys to success in the endeavor to reduce the painkiller epidemic.

Another key component in reducing the amount of lives affected by prescription painkillers is to focus on preventive healthcare. While accidents happen and pain from different sources can be inevitable, treating the problem shouldn’t make it more severe. Preventive healthcare, which conditions patients to keep an eye on their health, while also giving them the support they need in order to accomplish their health goals will enable them to manage their situation better than just relying on prescribed medicine to magically fix the situation.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
Being prescribed painkillers doesn’t mitigate the risk inherent in these drugs. It simply allows individuals the ability to consume them in a (hopefully) controlled environment. But the fact of the matter is that people are overdosing or becoming addicted to these drugs at an increased rate that coincides with the amount of prescriptions being issues, all without reducing pain. So what does that mean? It means that magic beans can grow into a giant beanstalk leading to a golden solution to pain, but you must first evade the giant looking to keep you trapped in his castle.

40,"Putting-on-Modified-Genes","Putting on Modified Genes","An individual’s genetic makeup has a lot to do with how they live their life: It determines if they will be predisposed to certain behaviors and diseases, and if they will inherit certain traits. Genes are so influential to animals, plants, and microorganisms (which all pass along their genes to their offspring) that the manipulation of them has become an area of great study, and great concern because the consequences of passing on engineered genes have unknown consequences so far.
<h3>Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)</h3>
According to the <a href=""http://www.nongmoproject.org/learn-more/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Non-GMO Project</a>, GMOs “are living organisms whose genetic material has been artificially manipulated in a laboratory through genetic engineering, or GE.” And while this source is admittedly biased, there is basis for concern as they go on to state in their FAQ that:

<em>“Most developed nations do not consider GMOs to be safe. In more than 60 countries around the world, including Australia, Japan, and all of the countries in the European Union, there are significant restrictions or outright bans on the production and sale of GMOs. In the U.S., the government has approved GMOs based on studies conducted by the same corporations that created them and profit from their sale. Increasingly, Americans are taking matters into their own hands and choosing to opt out of the GMO experiment.”</em>

So why do GMOs persist if they are considered unsafe by many? The answer is that being able to create organisms that have desired traits, such as crops that resist herbicides and animals that grow larger and faster, is profitable, practical, and can lead to scientific breakthroughs, such as cures for presently incurable diseases. But these benefits come into conflict by purported issues that arise from genetic engineering, such as more pesticides used on crops and leading to people being more prone to allergies and cancer. However, there are no conclusive studies that correlate GMOs to these negative claims.
<h3>Human Genetic Modification</h3>
While GMOs are the beginning, the natural end result of being able to manipulate the genes of organisms is to be able to do it with people. With that said, there has been a notable rejection of this potential use of genetic engineering from the <a href=""http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=9006"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Center for Genetics and Society (CGS)</a>. With an upcoming International Summit on Human Gene Editing, the CGS released an open letter detailing why they have chosen to take this stance. Of particular note are the themes of inequality and the lack of control that will pervade such a scenario once people have control of what genes get passed on.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
According to <a href=""http://www.healthline.com/health/gmos-pros-and-cons#1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Healthline</a>, “GMO seeds are used to plant 90 percent of corn, soybeans, and cotton grown in the U.S.” This means that Americans are almost guaranteed to have consumed and will continue to consume GMO products. There are proponents on both sides of the GMO debate, and while there are no conclusive studies connecting GMOs to many of the negative claims that come from those that oppose them, the fact remains that many prominent countries have made it clear that they want nothing to do with GMOs. On top of that, when it comes to genetic modification in humans, even scientists are extremely hazardous of the consequences, both known and unknown.

41,"Working-Memory-in-the-Information-Age","Working Memory in the Information Age","The information age can broadly be defined by the famous Steve Jobs quote about “…standing at the intersection of computers and humanism.” This is to say that the prevalence of data processing machines in a society that bonds through the passing of information is where we are now, and will be for the foreseeable future.

While the ability to communicate and collaborate instantly across vast distances has been a boon, the access this has granted us to each other and to large data stores has allowed for a certain issue to arise: How do people with limited working memory behave when their lives have been integrated with machines which have unlimited recall?
<h3>What is Working Memory?</h3>
Working memory is the mechanism that allows individuals to recall and organize critical pieces of information, usually simultaneously, so that said information can be applied to a certain task. A common example used to illustrate working memory is mental arithmetic where a person hears two numbers and must add, subtract, multiply, or divide these numbers in their head and produce an answer. As the numbers grow larger, the ability for the individual to process this data and generate an accurate solution diminishes. This example can be contrasted with a computer which can take exponentially large numbers and perform calculations on them instantly.

In the APA’s “<a href=""http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep05/workout.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A workout for working memory,</a>” two different theories regarding the limits of working memory were presented. On the one hand you had the theory of working memory being limited to seven different pieces of information at one time (such as recalling up to seven digits in a sequence), with anything greater having to be chunked (e.g., dividing a 10-digit number into chunks of five) for recall. This theory was contrasted with the idea that individuals can only retain one item in working memory, and the “n-back” test was employed to prove this. The n-back test, by the way, is when:

<img class=""alignright wp-image-1761"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ThinkstockPhotos-186481600.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth200ampnameThinkstockPhotos-186481600.jpg"" alt=""Think"" width=""350"" height=""350"" />

<em>“The participants [in the task] read a series of numbers, presented one at a time on a computer screen. In the easiest version of the task, the computer presents a new digit, and then prompts participants to recall what number immediately preceded the current one. More difficult versions might ask participants to recall what number appeared two, three or four digits ago.”</em>
As you can imagine, the recall times varied when recalling the previous digit in a sequence and recalling the digit that was presented four sequences ago. In the end, however, the article revealed that a study was able to improve recall times after participants practiced the n-back test for 10 hours in a five day span, meaning that working memory can be improved. But is there a cost?

<h3>Working Memory Overload and Cognitive Performance</h3>
In a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2854358/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">study</a> found on the National Institute for Biotechnology Information, researchers utilized the stress placed on individuals during the n-back test and monitored subsequent cognitive performance. The results were interesting. As you can imagine, the recall times among the individuals increased as they were tasked with recalling numbers further back in sequence; however, what happened when individuals had to recall numbers four sequences back and then were asked to recall a number only two sequences back? The study finds that:

<em>“Overloading the working memory system with a high-load 4-back task induced a significant decline in subsequent working memory function and robust decreases in brain activity in various regions including relatively large areas of the pre-frontal cortex.”  </em>
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health!</h3>
With so much information being consumed by individuals at one time (count how many tabs you have open in your internet browser), it can be argued that many people place high-loads on their working memory at a pretty consistent rate. On top of that, information consumption and processing doesn’t only happen at work. As these high-loads of information recall have been shown to have a negative effect on cognitive performance, individuals should try doing one thing at a time.

42,"The-Secret-to-Good-HealthNow-With-Eve","The Secret to Good Health, Now With Even More Evidence!","The NY Times recently posted an article with the headline “<a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/cutting-sugar-improves-childrens-health-in-just-10-days/?_r=0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Cutting Sugar Improves Children’s Health in Just 10 Days</a>,” where they cite a study where foods with added sugar (as distinct from naturally-occurring sugar found in fruits) were removed from children’s diets and replaced with carbohydrates to keep overall calorie intake the same.

This is significant because added sugar is typically refined sugar and is therefore stripped of all nutrients, essentially making them empty calories. But we’ll get back to that.

After the 10 day period, the results were considerable: While weight was unaffected during this time, their metabolic health changed significantly.

If you were wondering, metabolic health is how well you break down and utilize the nutrients and minerals found in foods and beverages. “Good” foods such as fruits and vegetables are easier to break down and provide numerous macro and micronutrients—in other words they offer more bang for your buck and help maintain your metabolism. “Bad” foods, typically those that are highly processed and refined, do the opposite.

But this is somewhat common knowledge. The truly shocking facet of this study is how quickly metabolic health was affected once added sugar was removed. From the article:

<em>“On average, the subjects’ LDL cholesterol, the kind implicated in heart disease, fell by 10 points. Their diastolic blood pressure fell five points. Their triglycerides, a type of fat that travels in the blood and contributes to heart disease, dropped 33 points. And their fasting blood sugar and insulin levels – indicators of their diabetes risk – likewise markedly improved.”</em>

To further the point about how significant this is, the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Centers of Disease Control and Prevention</a> remark that as of 2012, “about half of all adults—117 million people—had one or more chronic health conditions.” These conditions, also known as lifestyle diseases (think about that), include “heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and arthritis—are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems.”

So by know I think you know where I’m going with this: This study showed how quickly added sugar destroys the body and begins to set the foundation for chronic disease later on in life. Unhealthy individuals don’t just become unhealthy; they always were, since childhood.
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health</h3>
Refined sugars are stripped of all macro and micronutrients making them “empty calories.” But the misconception is that “empty calories” simply cause weight gain, when in realty they cause weight gain through the deterioration of one’s metabolism—which of course leads to other problems besides having a gut. And on the topic of guts, alcohol (such as the seemingly innocuous beer) contains refined sugars, refined carbohydrates, and an addictive agent as a nice cherry on top.

So what did we learn? The mountain of evidence tells us to cut out added sugars (and on a related note alcohol) from our diet. But the marketing for these products will encourage consumption. As always the choice will be yours…

43,"Healthy-Concerns-for-Women","Healthy Concerns for Women","Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, according to the <a href=""http://www.wcrf.org/int/cancer-facts-figures/data-specific-cancers/breast-cancer-statistics"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">World Cancer Research Fund</a>; additionally, breast cancer is 100 times more likely to develop in women than in men, which means that simply being a woman is a huge risk factor for the disease.

This brings up a very interesting issue: how does being a woman affect one’s health? The answer, according to MedlinePlus, is quite significantly. With October designated as “Breast Cancer Awareness Month,” the parade of pink ribbons should serve as a reminder that women must take their overall health seriously.

Medline Plus states that, “Women have unique health issues. And some of the health issues that affect both men and women can affect women differently.” These unique health issues involve being pregnant, going through menopause, and being at greater risk for certain conditions—namely breast cancer and osteoporosis.

In addition to unique health problems for women, MedlinePlus states that:
<ul>
 	<li>""Women are more likely to die following a heart attack than men</li>
 	<li>Women are more likely to show signs of depression and anxiety than men</li>
 	<li>The effects of sexually transmitted diseases can be more serious in women</li>
 	<li>Osteoarthritis affects more women than men</li>
 	<li>Women are more likely to have urinary tract problems”</li>
</ul>

As this is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, getting a mammography screen—particularly in middle aged women—is important; but more important is for all women to take a step back and evaluate their overall health.

Ask yourself: Am I getting enough vitamins and nutrients in my diet? Do I exercise regularly? Have I had a pap test done? Am I heart healthy? Am I considering getting pregnant? Am I already pregnant, and if so have I visited a midwife or obstetrician? Am I approaching menopause?
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health</h3>
While breast cancer may not seem like a pressing concern for some women, use the marketing that surrounds this month as a reminder to ensure your overall health.

44,"Don-t-Contract-With-Contacts","Don’t Contract With Contacts","Wearing contact lenses is typically a convenient and safe form of vision correction, but sometimes convenience breeds complacency.

Keeping your contacts clean and maintained is of the utmost importance because these medical devices are placed directly on the eye, and unhygienic use will eventually cause certain eye infections and vision problems.

And while this may appear obvious, it isn’t unheard of for contact lens wearers to forget to wear, wash or store their lenses properly, or even discard them after prolonged use.

Actually that last point—about it not being unheard of for contact lens wearers to exhibit unhygienic behavior—is an understatement. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:

<em> “An estimated one in six adults in the United States wears contact lenses, and one third of them report at least one health care visit for a red or painful eye while wearing lenses. Approximately 99% of contact lens wearers reported at least one risk behavior ever for eye infections or inflammation. Of particular concern, contact lens wearers of all types frequently reported exposure of their contact lenses to water, including storing or rinsing their lenses in tap water and showering or swimming while wearing lenses.”</em>

This is very revealing. It means that contact lens wearers are among the most at-risk for eye infections. And it's not only because they neglect to care for their contacts. A recent <a href=""http://nyulangone.org/press-releases/contact-lens-wearers-take-note-your-eyes-may-get-more-infections-because-their-microbiomes-have-changed"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">study</a> by NYU Langone reports that the bacteria present in the eyes of contact wearers is different from that of non-wearers:

<em>“Specifically, the NYU Langone team found that the eye surface, or conjunctiva, has surprisingly higher bacterial diversity than the skin directly beneath the eye and three times the usual proportion of Methylobacterium, Lactobacillus, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas bacteria in the eyes of the study’s nine contact lens wearers than is typically found on the surface of the eyeballs of 11 other men and women in the study who did not wear contact lenses. When measured and plotted on a graph, statistical germ diversity scores showed that the eye microbiome of contact lens wearers had a composition more similar to that of the wearer’s skin than the eye microbiome of non-lens wearers.” </em>
<h3>The Bottom Line – For Your Health</h3>
It is almost ironic that the devices used to improve one’s vision so that he/she may have a greater quality of life may, in the end, cause that person to have diminished or lost vision. In the end, contact lens wearers should be more prudent with their vision.

45,"Considering-Men-s-Health","Considering Men’s Health","September is considered “National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month,” where numerous organizations and experts seek to raise awareness for prostate health, inform about the risk factors for prostate cancer, and encourage prostate screenings.

This month is right before “National Breast Cancer Awareness Month” (October) where there is a similar push for awareness and prevention, but this time for the breasts.

Both men and women can get both types of cancers, but prostate cancer is much more prevalent in men and breast cancer is much more prevalent in women, inevitably causing gendered associations.

While October enjoys a flood of pink ribbons (the symbol used in support of breast cancer), you’d be hard-pressed to find a blue ribbon (the symbol used in support of prostate cancer) in September—which underpins a major issue: Men’s health, in general, needs a major push so that men of all ages can be made aware of their increased risk for disease and death.
<h3>A Proclivity for Lifestyle Diseases</h3>
According to <a href=""http://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/everyday-healthy-living/sexual-health/men-take-charge-of-your-health#the-basics_1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Healthfinder.org</a>, compared to women, men are more likely to:
<ul>
 	<li>“Smoke</li>
 	<li>Drink alcohol</li>
 	<li>Make unhealthy or risky choices</li>
 	<li>Put off regular checkups and medical care”</li>
</ul>
These behaviors are all common risk factors for lifestyle diseases—those that are associated and brought upon by how an individual lives. These diseases, according to <a href=""http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=38316"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Medicinenet.com</a>, include “atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke; obesity and type 2 diabetes; and diseases associated with smoking and alcohol and drug abuse.”

Additionally, lifestyle disease is becoming more of a problem in the U.S. According to the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/p0501-preventable-deaths.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>:

<em>“The five leading causes of death in the United States are heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, and unintentional injuries. Together they accounted for 63 percent of all U.S. deaths in 2010, with rates for each cause varying greatly from state to state.” </em>

Unsurprisingly, the <a href=""http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/life-expectancy-by-gender/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Kaiser Family Foundation</a> finds that life expectancy of a man is several years fewer than that of a woman, which speaks nothing of the quality of life that a man who smokes, drinks, and makes unhealthy choices leads.
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
From this we can gather that men are a prime audience for preventive healthcare and education. Unfortunately, the reason for this is because they are more susceptible to unhealthy behavior. As this month is Prostate Cancer Awareness Month—essentially a month designated for men’s health considering the gendered association—and seeing the extreme push that occurs for Breast Cancer Awareness (which is typically aimed at female health), now is the time for men to consider their current and future states of health.

But to do something in moderation requires one to know what is considered extreme, and when it comes to alcohol consumption, considering recent <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/07/craft-beers-get-heavy-on-the-alcohol.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">trends</a>, what may appear as moderate drinking could quietly be a binge drinking environment in reality.
<h3>Understanding Alcohol and the Standard Drink</h3>
Alcohol is also known as ethanol, and is a neurotoxic, psychedelic chemical compound that is formed by the fermentation of sugars and yeasts. It is absorbed in both the stomach and small intestine where it is metabolized by liver enzymes. When alcohol is broken down and absorbed by the body its properties produce an intoxicating effect on the individual with the effect becoming more pronounced the higher one’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level.

The <a href=""http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Practitioner/pocketguide/pocket_guide2.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)</a> states that, “A standard drink is any drink that contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol (about 0.6 fluid ounces or 1.2 tablespoons).” This translates to 12 oz of a beverage containing 5 percent alcohol, 5 oz of a beverage containing 12 percent alcohol, and 1.5 oz  of a beverage containing 40 percent alcohol all constituting one “standard drink.” And according to the <a href=""http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/DietaryGuidelines2010.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Dietary Guidelines for Americans</a>, moderate drinking is up to one standard drink per day for women and up to two standard drinks per day for men. While this may seem easy enough to abide by, the problem occurs when a standard drink serving (of 12 oz for example) doesn’t come with <em>standard</em> alcohol content for the serving size.

The Health Services at Brown University state that:

<em>“Understanding the rate of metabolism is critical to understanding the effects of alcohol. In general, the liver can process one ounce of liquor (or one standard drink) in one hour. If you consume more than this, your system becomes saturated, and the additional alcohol will accumulate in the blood and body tissues until it can be metabolized.”</em>

And as <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/07/craft-beers-get-heavy-on-the-alcohol.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CNBC</a> remarks, craft beers “whose sales grew 22 percent to $19.6 billion in 2014 and continued a four-year streak of double digit growth, is driving a sea change in American palates with heavier doses of alcohol.”

What this means is that Americans crave the type of beer that comes with higher alcohol content, yet the serving sizes of these craft beers are typically 12 oz. So if you drink a 12 oz beer with an alcohol by volume (ABV) of 10 percent, then you’ve just had two standard drinks in one sitting and there is roughly 14 grams of pure alcohol floating in your system waiting to be metabolized.
<h3>Drinking Levels Revisited</h3>
The <a href=""http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/moderate-binge-drinking"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">NIAAA</a> states that, “binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels to 0.08 g/dL. This typically occurs after 4 drinks for women and 5 drinks for men—in about two hours.” And that heavy drinking is, “drinking 5 or more drinks on the same occasion on each of 5 or more days in the past 30 days.”

As you may have noticed these higher levels of drinking are defined by BAC and not how many beer bottles you’ve accumulated. For example, if you had two bottles of a 12 oz craft beer with a 10 percent ABV you might consider your drinking habits to be in moderation, but with the higher alcohol content, these two beers would cause your BAC to go up to 0.055g/dL as opposed to 0.027g/dL as it would with two “standard” drinks.

The increased demand for craft beers with high ABVs, the drinking culture established in college, and the marketing efforts used in media to normalize drinking all weave together to create a hazardous environment where the need to drink (media), meets past behavior (college), and mixes with current trends (high ABVs) to beg the question, what is moderate?<span style=""font-size: 13px;""> </span>
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
Moderate drinking isn’t impossible and even has some marginal health benefits. However, there are numerous factors that need to be weighed heavily when deciding to drink, such as: how have I historically approached drinks, how do I view media that promotes alcohol (favorably?), and what type of alcohol do I gravitate towards? The answer to these questions will enable you to determine whether you are likely to drink in moderation; but still, such as the case with rising ABVs, the term “drink responsibly” is also subject to change.

47,"Digestive-HealthFiber","Digestive Health: Fiber","According to the Health Services department at Cornell University (Gannet), “The most immediate benefit of dietary fiber is its improvement of digestive function.” This article will examine fiber’s role in digestion with particular emphasis on how it affects the colon.
<h3>What is Dietary Fiber?</h3>
According to <a href=""https://www.gannett.cornell.edu/cms/pdf/chep/upload/fiber-digestion-and-health.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Gannet</a>, “Dietary fiber is the edible component of plant foods that can’t be digested by humans.” While it doesn’t provide any nutritional value, dietary fiber aids digestion by improving the absorption of nutrients, the presence of intestinal bacteria, and the colon’s motility (moving indigestible material to the rectum).

There are two types of dietary fiber: soluble (able to be dissolved in water) and insoluble fiber.

According to <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002136.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Medline Plus</a>, soluble fiber dissolves into a gel substance when it reaches the colon. This process occurs through colonic fermentation—whereby bacteria in the colon interact with ingested material in order to produce gases and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which have numerous health benefits including controlling blood glucose (sugar) levels and improving intestinal immune function.

Insoluble fiber doesn’t dissolve in water, but rather attracts and absorbs it. This serves to add bulk to your diet as it makes you feel full, improve the consistency of stool through hydration, and increases bowel movements by engaging colonic motility.

Soluble fiber is found in “oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables,” whereas insoluble is found in “wheat bran, vegetables, and whole grains.”
<h3>Utilizing Dietary Fiber for Improved Health</h3>
<img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-1538"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ThinkstockPhotos-479726218.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth185ampnameThinkstockPhotos-479726218.jpg"" alt=""Food"" width=""339"" height=""508"" />Adding fiber to your diet is one of the best ways to improve your digestive health, especially if you suffer from constipation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Constipation is a result of infrequent bowel movements (typically less than 3 times a week) which tend to produce hard and dry stool. Insoluble fiber addresses these issues as it absorbs water in the colon during digestion and both softens and moistens stool. In addition, the consistency of this stool is able to be easily moved to the rectum by the colon, increasing bowel movement.

IBS typically includes abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements. While treatment outside of diet (e.g., being prescribed probiotics and going to stress management) aid in treating this complex disease, adding fiber is still one of the quickest and most effective solutions to controlling symptoms. As mentioned previously, fiber increases regularity constipation and improves consistency which relieves constipation and diarrhea respectively. As there is no single treatment for IBS—and particularly the pain associated with it—prevention is the best form of medicine. Sticking to a healthy diet with plenty of fiber, along with performing exercise and other healthy behaviors, is the best way to combat this disease.
<h3>Dietary Fiber Recommendations</h3>
While fiber is important for digestive health, too much of it can cause symptoms that typically result from poor digestive health; e.g., gas, bloating, and abdominal pain. According to <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002470.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Medline Plus</a>, “The average American now eats 10 to 15 grams of fiber per day. The recommendation for older children, adolescents, and adults is to eat 20 to 35 grams of fiber each day.”
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
As the average American doesn’t get enough fiber in their diet it is likely beneficial that the inclusion of additional fiber will aid in digestive health. Both types of fiber (soluble and insoluble) are necessary for the proper maintenance of the colon and to prevent issues that stem from poor colonic health (e.g., constipation, diarrhea, etc). Whole grains, nuts and seeds, and fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of fiber and should always be added to your diet.

48,"Digestive-HealthDisorders","Digestive Health: Disorders","When it comes to peace of mind, your gut is largely influential. In fact, a 2008 paper titled, “<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2805706/pdf/nihms162299.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Brain foods: the effects of nutrients on brain function</a>,” goes into detail on how the nutrients of food impact the enzymes of the gut, which consequently interact with neurons in the brain. But even though food has a real affect on mood (and brain function for that matter), many Americans suffer from digestive disorders. The <a href=""http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/digestive-diseases-statistics-for-the-united-states.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)</a> remarks that “60 to 70 million people are affected by all digestive diseases’—almost a quarter of the population.

Digestive disorders impact the processing of nutrients and bring on discomfort. Some of the most common are chronic constipation, acid reflux, gallstones and irritable bowel syndrome. This article will examine these disorders and setup one’s diet as the main determinant to good (or bad) digestive health.
<h3><strong>Chronic Constipation</strong></h3>
One of the worst feelings is being backed up, and unfortunately many Americans face this scenario on a daily basis. According to the <a href=""http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/artic/constipation_niddk.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">NIDDK</a> constipation “is the most common gastrointestinal complaint in the United States” accounting for 2 million annual doctor visits and $725 million spent annually on laxatives.

Constipation is described as infrequent (less than three times a week) bowel movements which are hard and dry in appearance and texture. For comparison, many individuals move their bowels one to three times a day.

Constipation occurs when the large intestines, responsible for absorbing fluid and nutrients of food before it moves to the rectum, absorbs too much fluid leaving a hardened stool. These stools are difficult to pass and result in infrequent bowel movements.

While typically seen as more of an annoyance than anything, constipation (when chronic) can lead to problems that can become severe. Hemorrhoids (swollen or inflamed veins in the anal canal), anal fissures (a skin break or tear in the anal canal), and fecal impaction (hard stool packed in the intestine and rectum over time) are complications that can result from constipation.

The causes of constipation are varied, but the most common are: not enough fiber in the diet, not enough liquids in the diet, pregnancy, lack of exercise, stress, and ironically the overuse of laxatives.
<h3><strong>Acid Reflux</strong></h3>
For those who’ve ever had heartburn, the thought of getting it again is enough to throw off one’s appetite. Heartburn is caused by acid reflux, a situation where the lower esophageal sphincter (the circular group of muscles that control what goes into the stomach from the esophagus) either doesn’t close all the way after allowing food to pass or opens to frequently. This allows stomach acid to enter the esophagus and creates a burning sensation.

Individuals who have frequent heartburn, typically twice or more a week should see a doctor as they may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). According to <a href=""../../../../com/eheintl/www/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">NIDDK</a>, some common symptoms of GERD is: “bad breath, nausea, pain in your chest or the upper part of your abdomen, problems swallowing or painful swallowing, respiratory problems, vomiting, the wearing away of your teeth”.

If left untreated, GERD can cause complications such as esophagitis (damaged tissue lining the esophagus leading to bleeding and ulcers), difficulty swallowing, respiratory problems, and Barret’s esophagus (a condition where esophagus tissue is replaced by tissue resembling that found in the intestine). Unchecked cases of esophagitis and Barret’s esophagus can lead to cancer.

Treating reflux involves lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery if necessary. Lifestyle changes involve abstaining from smoking, drinking alcohol, and eating greasy, spicy foods. Medications typically involve ingesting an antacid. Surgery is usually an extreme case and typically involves the individual suffering from some physical abnormality that allows GERD to persist.
<h3><strong>Gallstones</strong></h3>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-1535"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ThinkstockPhotos-493705897.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth300ampnameThinkstockPhotos-493705897.jpg"" alt=""Woman on Couch"" width=""367"" height=""255"" />Like kidney stones, gallstones are hardened material that can become trapped in troublesome places. The gall bladder contains the secreted bile from the liver before it is used in the small intestines. The bile gets to the small intestine via the biliary tract. If a gallstone (or stones) gets trapped in the biliary tract it can sudden and shooting pain in the abdomen, known as a gallbladder attack.

Gallstones can be really small or quite large (about the size of a golf ball). Also, there can be many gallstones present in the gallbladder at one time, each of which can vary in size. According to <a href=""http://womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/the-healthy-woman/digestive_health.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">womenshealth.gov</a> these stones are formed when there is an excess of cholesterol in the liquid bile or if the gallbladder doesn’t empty entirely or not enough.

Risk factors for gallstones include: having a family history of gallstones, being overweight or obese, consuming a energy-rich, nutrient-poor diet, losing a lot of weight very quickly, being older than 60, have diabetes, or are American Indian or Mexican American.

If a gallstone gets trapped in one of the bile ducts it can eventually cause severe damage to the biliary tract, the gallbladder, and the liver. Gallstones can even become fatal in this manner. Fortunately, individuals can reduce their risk for gallstones by eating a low-cholesterol diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and staying active.
<h3><strong>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</strong></h3>
IBS is a common yet mysterious disease: it affects approximately 10 to 15 percent of the US population yet doesn’t have a known cause, and diagnosis is based on a pattern of common digestion issues such as abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation—meaning it can easily be mistaken for something else.

According to the <a href=""http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/irritable-bowel-syndrome/Pages/definition-facts.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">NIDDK</a>, this disease is classified into four types: 1) IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), Mixed IBS (IBS-M), and Unsubtyped IBS (IBS-U). These distinctions are determined by stool sample and will affect the type of treatment advice from doctors.

Symptoms of IBS are typically abdominal pain and a change in bowel movement frequency. While these symptoms are minor, their triggers are many, such as: motility problems in the colon, consuming certain foods, and feelings of stress stemming from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder can all trigger IBS symptoms.

Treatment of IBS typically involves changes to one’s diet and going after the physical symptoms the person experiences—such as taking fiber supplements for constipation, antidepressants for stress, and antispasmodics to control motility.
<div>
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
Digestive disorders are common and share similarities in both symptoms and treatment. If you are having trouble going or are experiencing inexplicable abdominal pain then you should schedule a visit with your doctor if these conditions persist. Usually they will recommend a change in diet.

Of course, prevention is always better than treatment, so in the next entry in the “Digestive Health” series we will look at how diet affects the digestion system, for better or for worse.

49,"Maintaining-Health-While-Healthy-Part","Maintaining Health While Healthy Part 5: Food and Mood","When it comes to food and mood, you are what you eat. We tend to soothe ourselves with foods that contain high levels of added fat, sodium, and/or sugar—among other things—when we’re feeling strained. In fact, our current mood is an often overlooked component of our health. In order to maintain one’s health, individuals should understand the relationship food has on their mood.
<h3><strong>How Food affects the Brain</strong></h3>
It is common knowledge that foods have a basic, physical effect on the body; for example, if you eat too much junk food then you will get fat, or if you don’t eat for a few days you will feel weak. But foods also play a significant role in brain function and by extension one’s mood.

A 2008 paper titled, “<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2805706/pdf/nihms162299.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Brain foods: the effects of nutrients on brain function</a>,” published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience finds that hormones found in the stomach, specifically leptin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), insulin, and nutrients found in foods have been shown to influence cognition and emotion.

According to the paper, leptin is the hunger hormone that reduces one’s appetite (i.e. tells you when you are full) and “facilitates synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus,” which is responsible in strengthening our ability to learn and memorize new information. Ghrelin is a peptide hormone released from the stomach that raises one’s appetite and produces similar benefits as leptin. GLP1 regulates one’s metabolism and improves memory. Insulin is an essential hormone that is produced before, during, and after a meal and affects cognition. In addition, omega-3 fatty acids and micro-nutrients such as iron, zinc, folate, and vitamins A through E were shown to affect “neural pathways that are associated with synaptic plasticity.”

These findings present a biological connection between food and the brain, and the necessity of providing the brain with the right kinds of food. When it comes to eating, the hormones in the stomach work with the brain in order to regulate when we eat and stop eating when we feel full. But many foods eaten today (i.e. refined, processed, and packaged foods) can actually make you feel hungry (i.e. not full) cause insulin levels to spike. In an article titled “

<a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/07/29/11-foods-that-make-hungrier/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">11 foods that make you hungrier</a>,” the author lists many commonly consumed foods that studies show cause hunger by reducing leptin and spiking insulin. As the hormones in the stomach affect learning and memory, foods that constantly make us feel hungry or give us a quick boost of energy (all while lacking essential nutrients) eventually influence our brains into seeing them in an overwhelmingly positive light.

When a food tastes bad or makes us feel sick, we begin to form negative associations with that food. This is a basic biological function that has helped people stay away from consuming things that were harmful to them, such as poison which can also be found in certain kinds of berries and mushrooms. But when a food tastes good and makes us feel energetic , we form positive associations. These foods taste good and make us feel energetic. And in the case of foods that reduces leptin production and spikes insulin levels, hormones shown to affect learning and memory, the positive association gets promoted to borderline addiction. Refined, packaged, and processed foods cause cravings, anticipation, highs, and then lows—an emotional roller coaster.
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
The “Brain foods” paper concludes that: “Brain networks that are associated with the control of feeding are intimately associated with those that are involved in processing emotions, reward and cognition.” What this means is that food affects your brain on a neurological level. Healthy foods form positive associations that lead to better health and peace of mind. Refined, packaged, and processed foods form positive associations that lead to cravings and emotional mood swings, typically compounded by the fact that these foods also lead to obesity and other issues. Don’t reward good behavior with junk, and don’t allow negative feedback to occur if you’ve cheated on your diet. The consequences of these actions are more significant than just feeling bad.

50,"Maintaining-Health-While-Healthy-Part","Maintaining Health While Healthy Part 4: Nutrition Facts Label and Ingredients List","Foods that are refined, processed, and/or packaged – whether organic or non-organic – often contain high levels of added sodium/salt, saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, added sugars/caloric sweeteners, added fats/oils, refined flours/grains, and/or hydrogenated/Trans fats. As your diet is critical in maintaining your health, knowing how to read the Nutrition Facts Label and the Ingredients List on food items is necessary in understanding exactly what you’re putting into your body. This article will examine these two items and can help you to make better food decisions.
<h3><strong>What is the Nutrition Facts Label?</strong></h3>
Commonly found on the back of packaged food items, the Nutrition Facts Label displays pertinent nutritional information about a particular food product (See Figure 1). In 1990, the <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-104/pdf/STATUTE-104-Pg2353.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Nutrition Labeling and Education Act</a> made it mandatory that this label appear on food items regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This label contains key information that empowers individuals to make informed health choices including: the serving size and servings per container, the amount of calories consumed per serving, the amount of nutrients consumed per serving, and the recommended values of certain nutrients based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

[caption id=""attachment_1659"" align=""alignright"" width=""237""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-1659"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nutritionlabel.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth165ampnamenutritionlabel.jpg"" alt=""Figure 1: The Nutrition Facts Label as it appears on food. Image sourced from Wikipedia."" width=""237"" height=""454"" /> Figure 1: The Nutrition Facts Label as it appears on food. Image sourced from Wikipedia.[/caption]

The “Serving Size” and “Servings per Container” values at the top of the label can be used to guide understanding of the other values on the label. For example, if one serving size portion contains 230 calories and 160mg of sodium, then two serving size portions will contain 460 calories and 320mg of sodium. The serving size, per the FDA, is standardized across similar foods and is shown in units such as cups or teaspoons followed by their metric equivalents in grams.

The amounts of “Calories” per serving along with the amount of “Calories from Fat” are displayed beneath the servings per container. Both weight gain and loss are commonly associated with caloric intake, making this section of particular importance to many individuals. However, calories are simply energy, and solely managing one’s caloric intake doesn’t lead to lasting health as such an approach does not factor in nutrients. There is a reason that the term “empty calories” exists.

Beneath the calories is the “Nutrients” section which lists the values of important nutrients including fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, protein, and vitamins. For practical purposes, this section can be split up into two sub-sections: the nutrients that you want to limit and the nutrients that you want to maximize. In essence, foods containing vitamins (examples of which include vitamins A through K, iron, calcium, zinc, and so on) should be consumed in abundance, whereas foods with very little vitamins and/or large amounts of nutrients that are not vitamins (i.e. fat, cholesterol, etc.) should be limited.

Lastly, there is the section that includes nutrient intake recommendations based on a 2,000-calorie diet. As you may have noticed in Figure 1, the nutrients present on this list contain those that should be limited.
<h3><strong>Reading the List of Ingredients</strong></h3>
[caption id=""attachment_1660"" align=""alignright"" width=""461""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-1660"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ingredientslist.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth315ampnameingredientslist.jpg"" alt=""Figure 2: The List of Ingredients highlighted in red. Image sourced from the Boston Public Health Commission."" width=""461"" height=""308"" /> Figure 2: The List of Ingredients highlighted in red. Image sourced from the Boston Public Health Commission.[/caption]

While the Nutrition Facts Label goes a long way in making healthy food choices, it is only half of the picture. It is also important to know the ingredients that were used in making the food. The Ingredients List is normally found near the Nutrition Facts Label for convenience (See Figure 2).

According to the <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyEating/Understanding-Ingredients-on-Food-Labels_UCM_433234_Article.jsp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">American Heart Association</a>, there are two things to consider when reading the Ingredients List:

<strong>The “ingredients are listed in order of quantity.”</strong> This means that the first few ingredients listed will be the ones that are primarily incorporated into the food. For example, in Figure 2 above, water, black beans, tomatoes, tomato paste, corn, and red bell pepper are the primary ingredients of the food product (in descending order), with the rest of the ingredients making up less than two percent of the food.

While the ingredients list displayed in Figure 2 is easy to read and understand, many other products aren’t so…digestible (See Figure 3 below).

[caption id=""attachment_1661"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""879""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-1661"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/allergens.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth595ampnameallergens.jpg"" alt=""Figure 3: List of Ingredients in the popular breakfast cereal “Lucky Charms.” Image sourced from Berkeley."" width=""879"" height=""176"" /> Figure 3: List of Ingredients in the popular breakfast cereal “Lucky Charms.” Image sourced from Berkeley.[/caption]

2. The “ingredients can go by several names.” As you will notice in Figure 3, the marshmallows have the second largest presence in the food and include several types of added sugar (among other additives). This brings us to the fact that certain ingredients, in this case sugar, can go by different names (i.e. “sugar,” “corn syrup,” and “dextrose”). In fact, many seemingly common ingredients can go by a variety of names. To fully understand what you are consuming, consult materials from the
<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm094211.htm#types"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">FDA</a> and other sources which help to demystify ingredient names.
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
In order to maintain your health, you must watch what you eat; however, simply choosing organic, sugar-free, or reduced calorie products won’t do the trick. You must know and understand the Nutrition Facts Label as well as the Ingredients List in order to ensure that what you’re putting into your body is: a) healthy and b) suitable for your current dietary needs. When selecting a product from the grocery store, it is recommended that you turn the container over and read the back.

51,"Maintaining-Health-While-Healthy-Part","Maintaining Health While Healthy Part 3: Organic Foods","In the previous entry of the “Maintaining Health” series, it was established that what you put into your body is the most important factor in maintaining your health.

But while reducing or eliminating refined, processed, and/or packaged foods is fundamental advice for cleaning up your diet, sometimes things get lost in translation when it comes time to shop.

According to the <a href=""http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/natural-resources-environment/organic-agriculture/organic-market-overview.aspx"">United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)</a>, the demand for organic produce has exploded from 2005 to 2014 and the trend looks to continue. However, it is important to note that simply eating organic food doesn’t necessarily mean that one’s diet is safer and more nutritious.
<h3><strong>What does “USDA Organic” Mean?</strong></h3>
According to the <a href=""http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateC&amp;navID=NationalOrganicProgram&amp;leftNav=NationalOrganicProgram&amp;page=NOPConsumers&amp;description=Consumers&amp;acct=nopgeninfo"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">USDA</a> itself:

<em>“Organic is a labeling term that indicates that the food or other agricultural product has been produced through approved methods. These methods integrate cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. Synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, irradiation, and genetic engineering may not be used.”</em>

In addition to the above, the <a href=""http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/NOPOrganicLabeling"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">National Organic Program</a> of the USDA observes 4 organic distinctions:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>100 Percent Organic:</strong> In this category, all ingredients and processing aids must be organic, the information panel must identify organic ingredients, and the product may display the USDA organic seal.</li>
 	<li><strong>Organic:</strong> In this category, most of the ingredients are organic, but non-organic ingredients specified on a National List may be used as well (up to five percent of food content). Foods that are organic must identify organic ingredients and may display the USDA organic seal.</li>
 	<li><strong>“Made with organic:</strong>” This category specifies multi-ingredient products that contain at least 70 percent organic ingredients. The information panel must identify these ingredients, and the product may display up to three organic ingredients or ingredient categories on the front; the USDA organic seal may not be used.</li>
 	<li><strong>Specific organic ingredients:</strong> This category specifies multi-ingredient products with less than 70 percent of its ingredients being organic. These products may only list its organic ingredients on the back as such and may not display the USDA organic seal.</li>
</ul>
It should be noted that none of the aforementioned categories require the inclusion of labels for livestock products such as:<em> free-range, cage-free, natural, grass-fed, pasture-raised, humane, and no added hormones.</em>
<h3><strong>How Does Organic Food Compare to Non-Organic Food?</strong></h3>
Individuals who aren’t familiar with the definition(s) of organic food tend to think that they are paying a premium for food that is safer and more nutritious than non-organic food; however, this is only partially true. According to a study published in the <a href=""http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1355685"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Annals of Internal Medicine</a>, the nutritional content of organic foods was not determined to be significantly more nutritious than non-organic food; but the study goes on to say that the consumption of “organic foods may reduce exposure to pesticide residues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.”

Since the nutritional comparison of organic foods to non-organic foods is mostly a moot point, individuals who are looking to understand why choosing organic foods could be beneficial should look to what forms of pesticides are used on the food. According to the <a href=""http://npic.orst.edu/health/ovc.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">National Pesticide Information Center (NPIC)</a>, organic foods have less pesticide residue when compared to their conventionally-grown counter-parts (non-organic food). Additionally, organic products may not use synthetic pesticides.

While “organic pesticides vs. synthetic pesticides” is an ongoing debate in need of further research, with some sources remarking upon the harmlessness of both (<a href=""http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/03/20/myth-busting-are-synthetic-pesticides-used-with-some-gmos-more-dangerous-than-natural-ones/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">1</a>, <a href=""http://farmguide.org/article_organic_vs_chemical.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">2</a>), what has been decided is that organic foods contain less pesticide residue.
<h3><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h3>
Choosing organic foods over non-organic foods won’t have a drastic effect on your health. Organic foods aren’t significantly more nutritious than non-organic foods and may still be refined, processed, and/or packaged—meaning their nutritional content may be reduced.

Even with organic foods, the things to look out for remain the same: added sodium/salt, saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, added sugars/caloric sweeteners, added fats/oils, refined flours/grains, and hydrogenated/Trans fats. Individuals are encouraged to take note of these ingredients and their respective amounts as indicated on the Nutrition Label.

By making decisions based on nutritional content rather than focusing too heavily on organic vs. non-organic, you can ensure that your diet is healthy and nutritious.

52,"Maintaining-Health-While-Healthy-Part","Maintaining Health While Healthy Part 2: Food","This second “Maintaining Health…” blog is all about what we consume and understanding the value of our diets. By developing a deeper understanding of the role of food in our lives, we will be better prepared to make decisions that benefit our health.
<h3><strong>Making Your Diet Trend Towards Healthy </strong></h3>
In <a href=""../../../../com/eheintl/www/blog/maintaininghealth.html"">part 1</a>, it was stated that a healthy diet places emphasis on <em>“reducing and/or eliminating the intake of refined, processed, and packaged foods and moving toward an unrefined, unprocessed plant–based diet that is centered on fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables, intact whole grains and legumes.”</em> If one were to take a closer look at the quote, “reducing and/or eliminating the intake of refined, processed, and packaged foods” is really the key element as these are the foods that undermine our health, providing little-to-no nutritional value while contributing excessive calories to the diet.
<h3><strong>Refined Grains and Added Sugar</strong></h3>
There are two types of grains: whole grains and refined grains. According to <a href=""http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/grains.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">choosemyplate.gov</a>, “Whole grains contain the entire grain kernel ― the bran, germ, and endosperm. <strong>Examples of whole grains include</strong> whole-wheat flour, bulgur (cracked wheat), oatmeal, whole cornmeal, and brown rice. Refined grains have been milled, a process that removes the bran and germ. This is done to give grains a finer texture and improve their shelf life, but it also removes dietary fiber, iron, and many B vitamins. <strong>Some examples of refined grain products are</strong> white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice.”

When we consume a refined grain, we are consuming calories without obtaining as many nutrients with all the benefits of the whole grain. Studies show that consumption of whole grains can help to protect individuals from developing many chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. People who regularly consume whole grains also tend to have lower cholesterol levels and are less prone to obesity. Whole grain snacks include low–fat whole–grain crackers, breads, pretzels and cereals. To snack the right way, individuals should look for food items that are labeled ""100% whole grain"" and are low in salt, sugar and fat.

Added sugar is another major problem in the common American diet, equally as insidious as refined grains but potentially more <a href=""http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/sugar-problem/refined-sugar-the-sweetest-poison-of-all"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">harmful</a>. According to the <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyDietGoals/Sugar-101_UCM_306024_Article.jsp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">American Heart Association (AHA)</a>, added sugar can be found in: “soft drinks, sugars, candy, cakes, cookies, pies and fruit drinks (fruitades and fruit punch); dairy desserts and milk products (ice cream, sweetened yogurt and sweetened milk); and other grains (cinnamon toast and honey-nut waffles).”

Additionally, added sugar goes by many names on a food’s nutrition label, such as: “brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, fruit juice concentrates, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, malt sugar, molasses, raw sugar, sugar, sugar molecules ending in “ose” (dextrose, fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, sucrose), and syrup.”

There is naturally-occurring sugar found in fruits (which is made up of both glucose and ‘fructose’) and milk (where the sugar is made up of ‘lactose’). While the chemical structures of naturally–occurring sugars and added sugars are identical, there is an important difference. <a href=""http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/DietaryGuidelines2010.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><em>According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010</em></a>, whole foods that naturally contain sugars also naturally contain vitamins, minerals, fiber, water, and other essential nutrients — all of which contribute to ""diluting"" the concentration of sugar in the food. These foods and beverages include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, dairy products, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds that are prepared without added sugars, starches, solid fats, and sodium. These foods are high in nutrients (nutrient–dense) and low in calories. Foods and beverages that contain excessive amounts of added sugar, on the other hand, are not as nutritionally beneficial. Where there is added sugar, there are more calories but not more nutritional value. Items with added sugars are thus energy–dense and nutrient–poor — the overall calorie density of the food increases while the overall nutrient density decreases.

According to the <a href=""http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/dietary_guidelines_for_americans/PolicyDoc.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Guidelines</a> and a <a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1849985"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">recent study</a>, added sugar accounts for between 10 and 16 percent of the total calories in the average American diet. This number is far too high, especially when considering that for most individuals to meet their nutritional needs while staying within their calorie limits, the maximum percentage of calories from added sugar should not exceed 5 to 10 percent of total calories.
<h3><strong>Processed Foods</strong></h3>
Foods that are processed have been altered in some way to aid in consumption or distribution; and while this isn’t inherently bad, according the <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/goodfood/pages/what-are-processed-foods.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">National Health Service (NHS)</a>, these foods may (and typically) contain added salt, sugar, and fat. While it is possible to consume these items in moderation, the problem is that so many foods are processed that it is very easy for people to exceed the recommended limits of salt, sugar, and fat.
<h3><strong>Packaged Foods</strong></h3>
These foods are, as the name implies, packaged for convenience. They are similar to processed foods in that most packaged foods are altered in some way for distribution. And like processed foods, packaged foods aren’t inherently bad if your diet is low in added salt, sugars, and fats, or if the packaged food is simply whole food chopped and organized to fit in a box. However, packaged foods are listed in this article as many of them go the processed route and are modified with additives.

But seeing as many foods need to be packaged, <a href=""http://www.prevention.com/food/smart-shopping/smart-shopping-21-healthy-prepared-foods"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a> is a list of healthy packaged foods. The idea is to find those that are least-processed and have minimal amounts of additives.
<h3><strong>The Value of a Nutritious Diet</strong></h3>
More than any other component, what we put inside our bodies <a href=""http://www.fitness.gov/eat-healthy/why-is-it-important/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">determines</a> the trajectory of our health. According to the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, the most common health risk behaviors for chronic illnesses are: “lack of exercise or physical activity, poor nutrition, tobacco use, and and drinking too much alcohol.” As one may observe, three out of the four health risk behaviors involve things that enter the body.

Now, abstaining from tobacco and limiting alcohol, while hard for some who’ve developed a habit, are pretty straightforward. Also, getting off the couch and walking around the block isn’t something that requires planning or foresight. Eating, on the other hand, is something that has to take place multiple times a day for survival, which leads to the crux of the health issue: while everybody must eat, individuals must be knowledgeable about their food choices in order to eat <em>healthy</em>.

53,"Maintaining-Health-While-Healthy-Part","Maintaining Health While Healthy Part 1: Getting There","Over a series of blog posts, we’re going to explore a relatively overlooked topic: how does one maintain health once initial health goals are met? As the saying goes, getting to the top (becoming healthy) can ultimately be the easy part when all is said and done; staying on top (maintaining one’s health for life) is the hard part.

Before we worry about staying at the top, however, let’s get there first. Let’s start by becoming un-unhealthy!

It’s no secret that America faces a health problem; the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/psr/npao/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> reports that: <em>“During 2009–2010, approximately 17% of children and adolescents and 36% of adults were obese.”</em>

The causes of this health problem are known:

<em>“Poor diet and physical inactivity contribute to many serious and costly health conditions, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, unhealthy cholesterol levels, and high blood pressure.”</em>

And since a poor diet and physical inactivity are the root causes of general health problems, it would follow that a <a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs394/en/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">healthy diet</a> and <a href=""http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/pa/en/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">physical activity</a> are the solutions.

In regard to a healthy diet, EHE International’s diet and nutrition expert Jeff Novick recommends:

<em>“A well–balanced diet with emphasis on reducing and/or eliminating the intake of refined, processed, and packaged foods and moving toward an unrefined, unprocessed plant–based diet that is centered on fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables, intact whole grains and legumes.”</em>

In regard to physical activity, the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CDC</a> recommends:

<em>“2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) of <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/glossary/index.html#mod-intensity"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">moderate-intensity aerobic activity</a> (i.e., brisk walking) every week and <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/glossary/index.html#muscle-strength"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">muscle-strengthening activities</a> on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).”</em>

<strong>Preparing for the Road Ahead</strong>

It would be easy to follow the above guidelines in an ideal scenario, but the real world is less accommodating, so before you get started there is one thing that you need to know: becoming and remaining healthy is like becoming and remaining wealthy, it’s all about consistency. If you want to stay healthy then you must commit to it absolutely.

Obesity has been shown to be a <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html"">significant risk factor</a> for “heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.” The kicker is that these obesity-related conditions are the leading causes of preventable death. Yes, <em>preventable</em> death. Fortunately, these issues can be resolved by becoming and/or staying physically fit.
<!--<br-->While people usually subscribe to the notion that physical fitness is for athletes and models, this article will present physical fitness as a preventive healthcare measure for everyone.
<h3>What is “Health-Related Physical Fitness?”</h3>
Getting active and ‘in-shape’ as a means to maintain one’s good health is termed “health-related physical fitness,” and the American College of Sports Medicine’s <em>Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription</em> defines it as:
<ul>
 	<li><em>“A state characterized by (a) an ability to perform daily activities with vigor, and (b) a demonstration of traits and capacities that are associated with low risk of premature development of hypokinetic diseases (i.e., those associated with physical inactivity.”</em> (pg. 57)</li>
</ul>
The “traits and capacities” mentioned are the components that determine health-related physical fitness. These include body composition, cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength and endurance, and flexibility.
<h3><strong>The Components of Health-Related Physical Fitness</strong></h3>
To better understand the importance of increasing your physical fitness, you must first understand the physical fitness components listed above.

<strong>Body composition:</strong> One’s body is naturally designed in a certain way. Some people are tall and others short, some people are bulky and others svelte. For this reason, body composition — the ratio of bodyweight made up of fat to that made up of fat-free tissue — is the preferred way to distinguish whether one is in a good place in regard to weight. Having a high ratio of fat to non-fat is detrimental to your health.

<strong>Cardiorespiratory endurance:</strong> This component is the one that most individuals associate with physical fitness as it involves many muscles in the body, is typically moderate-to-high intensity, and includes dynamic movements — all while being performed for extended periods of time. The standard method of determining cardiorespiratory endurance is measuring one’s maximal oxygen uptake (or rate of oxygen consumption) during exercise (typically cardiovascular exercise).

The <em>Guidelines for Exercise and Testing Prescription</em> states that:
<ul>
 	<li>“… (a) low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness have been associated with markedly increased risk of premature death from all causes and specifically from cardiovascular disease, (b) increases in cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with a reduction in death from all causes, and (c) high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with higher levels of habitual physical activity, which are, in turn, associated with many health benefits.” (pg. 68)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Muscular strength and endurance: </strong>When it comes to the muscles in your body, strength and endurance are the categories that will determine your physical fitness. ‘Muscular strength’ involves the amount of force that a muscle can generate in a given time, and ‘muscular endurance’ refers to the number of times a muscle can be used (contracted) without exhausting.
As with cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength and endurance has numerous health benefits including: increasing your metabolism, reducing the ratio of fat to fat-free tissue in the body, and increasing bone mass.

<strong>Flexibility:</strong> One of the more overlooked components of physical fitness, flexibility determines your range of motion. Being able to move without unnecessary encumbrance is key to physical fitness as it will determine your fitness ceiling. Inflexible people are unable to recruit their joints and muscles efficiently, and are thus limited in the exercises that they can perform. Put another way, inflexibility in a situation that might require greater range of motion (such as exercise) can cause tissue damage as the joints and muscles are pushed pass their limits.
<h3><strong>Tips and Exercises to Increase Health-Related Physical Fitness</strong></h3>
Now that we understand the importance of being physically fit along with the components of fitness, it is time to act on this knowledge. But first, here are some important guidelines to remember from EHE International Health Coach Gayle Salomon:
<ul>
 	<li>Focus o<img class=""alignright wp-image-1667"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Exercise1.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth325ampnameExercise1.jpg"" alt=""sport goods and a sports shoe"" width=""336"" height=""336"" />n you; don’t make comparisons with others unless it is used for motivation.</li>
 	<li>Physical fitness is about movement and activity. Try an exercise and see if you can do it; worry about performance later.</li>
 	<li>When just starting, remember to take it slow—progression is the aim.</li>
 	<li>Once you’ve become comfortable doing certain exercises/running certain distances, look to gradually increase the workload.</li>
 	<li>Age is a big factor in progression: the older you are, the more time it will take and the more care you should give to your fitness regimen.</li>
 	<li>When you start getting comfortable, you can switch up your routine by adding or targeting different muscle groups; just try something totally new so that you can keep improving.</li>
 	<li>Observe what you are doing so that progression may take place. Monitor your heart rate, count your steps, and time your runs. Take your exercise routine seriously by tracking your progress.</li>
</ul>
By adhering to these simple guidelines, you will have a safe and healthy mentality when looking to increase your physical fitness.
<h3><strong>Exercises</strong></h3>
<strong>Body composition: </strong>Becoming physically fit will naturally help your body composition, so there aren’t specific exercises for body composition.

<strong>Cardiorespiratory endurance: </strong>Some effective exercises are: walking, jogging, running, sprinting, interval training, bicycling, and swimming. Remember to start out slow; look to increase your workload as you feel more comfortable.

<strong>Muscular strength and endurance</strong>: Effective exercises include push-ups, sit-ups, squats, lunges, and calf-raises. For muscular strength, you should look to perform these movements with added weight; for muscular endurance, you should look to practice timed tests in which you perform as many repetitions as you can, without sacrificing form. Beginners should first get used to the movements and then look to improve. More advanced individuals should look to increase resistance for strength and increase time, repetitions, or both for endurance.

<strong>Flexibility training: </strong>These exercises should be performed every day, ideally twice a day — 5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes before going to bed. Flexibility training is similar to muscular training in that it is specific to target location (i.e., if you stretch your legs, your shoulders won’t necessarily increase in flexibility). Some effective exercises are: hamstring and quadriceps stretching (standing, sitting, or lying down), spinal twists, knees-to-chest, back extensions, forward and side lunges, shoulder stretches, and neck stretches. Beginners and advanced individuals should go as far as they can until they feel slightly uncomfortable — but not to the point of pain — and look to stretch, lunge, etc. a little further each time.
<h3><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h3>
Becoming physically fit is a mindset as much as it is a performance. By understanding the benefits of being physically fit and the types of exercise that will help you achieve your goals, you can embark on a journey toward a healthier life.

55,"Core-Muscles","Core Muscles","Over the past decade, the word “core” has become a very popular buzzword within the fitness community. There are many fitness product commercials and websites that equate the strengthening of one’s core to improved athletic performance. However, like many health-related topics, the true importance of the core is hidden underneath a commonly held misconception: that strengthening the core leads to improved performance. In actuality, the main benefit of a strong core is injury prevention.
<h3>What are the Core Muscles?</h3>
The muscles and tendons that make up an individual’s core include the rectus abdominis, transversus abdominis, internal and external obliques, erector spinae, multifidus, the pelvic floor, and the diaphragm; essentially, the <em>core</em> includes everything except for the limbs and appendages. The muscles of the core work to support, stiffen, and stabilize the spine, abdomen, and pelvis; distributing and generating force without placing undo stress on the joints.
<h3>Core Stability, Athletic Performance, and Injury Prevention</h3>
A core-strengthening program increases <em>core stability</em>, which is the capacity of the body to return to equilibrium (or balance) after being in a state of non-equilibrium. Activities that attempt to throw off the body’s equilibrium can generally be called “functional movements.” Participating in sports, riding the subway, and even getting up from a chair are functional movements as the body is constantly re-aligning its center of gravity to effectively handle force distribution.

<img class=""alignright wp-image-1519"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Class.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth307ampnameClass.jpg"" alt=""Class of diverse people doing pilates"" width=""402"" height=""268"" />Functional training, or training for specific movements, has become popular among athletes and fitness enthusiasts alike. The thinking is that if you train your body to effectively transfer force with movements that mimic those that would occur in a real-life scenario (like throwing a medicine ball to mimic passing a basketball), your body will adapt to these movements and be able to execute them better. This is the basis for the argument that core strength equals improved performance, and it is easy to make this argument when individuals are incorporating a total body workout in addition to core strengthening.

<a href=""http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2011/01000/Relationship_Between_Core_Stability,_Functional.36.aspx"">Study</a> after <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19026017"">study</a> has concluded, however, that functional training and core strengthening alone do not increase performance. You might be wondering then, “if this stuff doesn’t make me jump higher or run faster then what’s the point?” <em>The point is preventive healthcare.</em> While most studies attempting to link core strength and athletic performance have been met with underwhelming results, there is a wealth of literature espousing the link between core strength and injury prevention.

The article “<a href=""http://journals.lww.com/acsm-csmr/Abstract/2008/01000/Core_Stability_Exercise_Principles.14.aspx"">Core Stability Exercise Principles (2008)</a>,” remarks that individuals with lower back pain (LBP) have “delayed contraction of the transversus abdominis and multifidi prior to limb movement.” Additionally, the document notes that “people with sacroiliac pain have impaired recruitment of the diaphragm and pelvic floor.” This shows that individuals with weak cores are susceptible to these and other musculoskeletal injuries.

Another <a href=""http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1745-6673-2-3.pdf"">study</a> showed that in the dangerous world of firefighting, an occupation that requires extensive functional movements in less than ideal situations, injuries were reduced significantly when the firefighters were placed under a core strengthening program:

<em>“Comparing the number of injuries pre- and post- intervention of these 433 firefighters, loss time injuries were reduced by 62%, whereas total injuries were reduced by 44% compared to a historical group.”</em>

This is significant because, according to article, “injuries are the leading cause of mortality and loss of potential years of life for working individuals.”
<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
By only strengthening your core, you won’t become a better athlete because the core efficiently distributes force rather than generating it. What you will accomplish, however, is even more important. You will improve your body’s ability to maintain equilibrium, protect against injury and various health conditions related to the muscles and joints, and increase your functional independence.  So, while it may not improve your performance on the basketball court, functional training can increase the strength of the muscles that provide stability and mobility for the spine, pelvis, rib cage, and hips.

56,"Snow-Removal-Safety","Snow Removal Safety","From the novelty of the season’s first storm to the seemingly endless onslaught of recent weeks, snow has been a looming presence in the lives of many Americans this winter.

Of course, snow does have its perks. It is enjoyable to look at, ski on top of, sled through, and roll into snowmen and snowwomen. What is much less enjoyable is the fact that snow needs to be removed – from roads, driveways, sidewalks, stairs, and walkways.

And, while snow removal is almost always a nuisance, it can also be very dangerous if performed incorrectly or without proper precaution.

Here are some preventive health tips to keep in mind the next time you head outside to grab your shovel or start your snow blower:

<strong>Overall Health</strong> – Snow removal injuries can range from aches and muscle pulls to fatal heart attacks. If you have a medical condition or do not exercise regularly, it is important to consult a physician before shoveling or snow blowing.   It may not be a bad idea to hire someone to complete the work.

<strong>Clothing </strong>– According to the <a href=""http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/winter/duringstorm/outdoorsafety.asp"">CDC</a>, you should dress in several layers of loose-fitting wool, silk, or polypropylene clothing; wear a hat, mittens, and a scarf or mask that covers the face and mouth; and wear a tightly-woven, wind and water-resistant coat and water-resistant boots.  Additionally, go indoors if persistent shivering occurs. Shivering should not be ignored as it is an important first sign that the body is losing heat.

<strong>Sun Safety </strong>– According to the <a href=""http://www.skincancer.org/healthy-lifestyle/outdoor-activities/essential-sun-safety-information-for-skiers-and-snowboarders"">Skin Cancer Foundation (SCF)</a>, “snow reflects up to 80 percent of the UV light from the sun, meaning that you are often hit by the same rays twice.” Apply a broad–spectrum, water–resistant sunscreen of at least SPF 30 to all exposed areas 30 minutes before going outdoors. Reapply every two hours or as needed. You can protect your eyes and vision by wearing goggles or sunglasses that block 99 to 100 percent of both UVA and UVB rays.

<strong>Snow Removal Technique</strong> –<a href=""http://newsroom.aaos.org/media-resources/news/snow-shoveling-throw-out-injuries-this-winter-not-your-back.htm"">The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)</a> recommends the following precautions:
<ul>
 	<li><img class=""alignright wp-image-1728"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Snow3.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth353ampnameSnow3.jpg"" alt=""Snow"" width=""409"" height=""271"" />Warm up muscles (especially the back, arm and leg muscles) by stretching for at least ten minutes before beginning snow removal.</li>
 	<li>Use a shovel that is appropriate for your height and strength.</li>
 	<li>Hold the shovel close to the body and always try to push rather than lift the snow. If lifting the snow cannot be avoided, it is important to do it properly by squatting with feet apart and lifting with the legs while keeping the back straight.</li>
 	<li>Lift only small amounts of snow at one time. Snow should never be thrown over the shoulder or to the side as those motions require twisting of the back and can lead to injury.</li>
 	<li>Remove snow early and often during a snowstorm when the snow is light and powdery.</li>
 	<li>Read instructions and carefully follow precautions listed in the operations manual when using a snow blower.</li>
 	<li>Never stick hands in a snow blower. If snow becomes too impacted, stop the engine and wait at least five seconds before using a solid object to clear wet snow or debris from the chute.</li>
 	<li>Take frequent breaks and drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. For both men and women, the most common sign of a heart attack is chest pain, pressure, or discomfort. Anyone who experiences these or other symptoms of a heart attack should stop and seek emergency care immediately.</li>
</ul>
So, the next time you head outdoors to remove snow, do it safely - take some extra time and heed the recommendations listed above.

57,"Health-Benefits-of-Exercise-Is-a-Foun","Health Benefits of Exercise Is a Fountain of Youth","Looking and feeling young and fit seems to be a top priority in the U.S., as Americans dole out over $12 billion for <a href=""http://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/plastic-surgery-statistics/2013.html"">cosmetic surgeries</a> in a year, and the average woman will spend $15,000 on <a href=""https://www.mint.com/blog/consumer-iq/splurge-vs-save-which-beauty-products-are-worth-the-extra-cost-0413/?display=wide"">make-up in her life time</a>. Looking healthy and vital, however, is not something that we have to buy. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and proper medical care are the best ways to slow the aging process.

Living well is its own proverbial fountain of youth.
<h3>Oxygen: Can’t Live With It and Can't Live Without It</h3>
In the 1950s, Dr. Denham Harman developed the scientific understanding of “free radicals” as the cause of aging. Basically, “<a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/finding-the-fountain-of-youth/"">the theory says</a> a byproduct of oxygen use is adverse chemical reactions in cells. The result is aging and, ultimately, death.” We can slow the production of free radicals by staying fit and eating right. We can also limit the production of new free radicals by avoiding excessive smoking and drinking. However, aging is not something that can be stopped altogether. It is a natural process of living organisms.
<h3>Active Equals Younger</h3>
Although aging is not fully understood by science, a new study published in the <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.2014.282863/abstract"">Journal of Physiology</a> is adding to the growing body of knowledge regarding the role of fitness in the aging process. Researchers evaluated older adults who were avid cyclists compared to a sedentary group.

“Active older people resemble much younger people physiologically,” writes the <a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/how-exercise-keeps-us-young/?ref=health"">New York Times</a>’ Gretchen Reynolds. “The findings suggest that many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is, to a large degree, up to us.”

Further <a href=""http://tf.hu/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Rad%C3%A1k-Zsolt-NTK-41.pdf"">medical research</a> has examined the ability of regular exercise to “beneficially affect and retard biological aging.” The evidence points to consistent exercise as the most effective tool for remaining youthful and preventing the onset of aging (as much as biologically possible).

""If you had to pick one thing, one single thing that came closest to the fountain of youth,"" says James Fries, M.D., a pioneer researcher on healthy aging at Stanford University in an <a href=""http://www.aarp.org/health/fitness/info-01-2011/the_real_fountain_of_youth.html"">AARP article</a>, ""then it would have to be exercise.""

There are <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/31/anti-aging-exercises_n_3678467.html"">certain exercises</a> you can do to help resist aging. As with any new fitness routine, seek advice from your physician first. Until the fountain of youth is discovered, we have the tools for staying young in our own hands by simply exercising and living a healthy lifestyle. Ponce de Leon is not required.

A <a href=""http://www.fidelity.com/inside-fidelity/employer-services/health-care-survey-finds-spending"">National Business Group on Health survey</a> shows that spending on employee wellness programming increased by 15 percent in 2013 from the previous year, and the number of companies offering incentives for participation in such programs ""has increased from 57 percent in 2009 to 74 percent in 2014."" These trends include growth in subsidized gym memberships and exercise programs. A focus on fitness makes sense for all involved.

Companies reap <a href=""http://smallbusiness.chron.com/tax-incentives-companies-offer-gym-memberships-18505.html"">tax benefits</a> from fitness programs, and employees enjoy improved health outcomes by participating. A <a href=""../../../../com/eheintl/www/programs.html"">healthy workforce</a> may also result in further savings for companies through lower healthcare costs.

<a href=""http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/workplacewellnessmarketreview2012.pdf"">A 2012 U.S. Department of Labor-commissioned study</a> reports that ""30 percent of all employers and 63 percent of large firms provided either gym membership discounts or on-site exercise facilities"" for employees. However, <a href=""http://ohsonline.com/Articles/2013/09/01/Increasing-Employee-Participation-in-Corporate-Wellness-Programs.aspx?Page=1"">corporate incentives</a> alone may be enough to get some everyone to the gym. Many people struggle with motivation, scheduling, and knowing how to integrate exercise in their daily routine. The success of these fitness programs are defined by the employees who must take advantage of these benefits. One person’s motivation to go to the gym regularly is different from another.
<h3>Let’s Get Physical</h3>
Starting a physical activity regimen is easier with a gym membership. A gym's operating hours allow for a consistent exercise schedule regardless of weather, and a variety of equipment and activities help prevent boredom. If you have a membership, begin by planning workout times around your daily schedule. Develop your exercise plan based upon the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html"">Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</a>. In order to obtain health benefits, the Guidelines recommend adults perform the following:
<ul>
 	<li>2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (i.e., brisk walking) every week, plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that target all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).</li>
 	<li>OR 1 hour and 15 minutes (75 minutes) of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (i.e., jogging or running) every week, plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that target all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).</li>
 	<li>OR an equivalent mix of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity and muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week, plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that target all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).</li>
</ul>
As always, talk with a physician before you begin any new exercise program.
<h3>When a Gym Card Is Not Enough</h3>
Many of us struggle with finding the time and motivation to go to the gym regardless of a company discount and convenient access to a fitness center. It’s easy to make excuses. We convince ourselves we are too busy, too tired, or too bored with the gym. Many of us don’t see immediate results from exercise and give up. These fitness <a href=""http://www.healthywomen.org/content/blog-entry/four-common-i-hate-exercise-excuses-debunked"">roadblocks can be overcome</a>. The most important thing to do is to just keep active. EHE health coaches recommend:
<ul>
 	<li>Finding a motivation that works for you</li>
 	<li>Setting realistic goals and push yourself</li>
 	<li>Trying different types of exercises thath fit your lifestyle</li>
 	<li>Changing it up to keep workouts dynamic and engaging</li>
 	<li>Going with a gym partner to help motivate you to put on the sweat pants</li>
 	<li>Joining a group exercise class</li>
</ul>
<h3>It Doesn’t Matter Where You Sweat</h3>
If you don’t have a gym membership, there are many ways to be active outside of a spinning class and without an expensive treadmill. <a href=""http://acsm.org/about-acsm/media-room/news-releases/2011/08/01/acsm-issues-new-recommendations-on-quantity-and-quality-of-exercise"">The American College of Sports Medicine</a> recommends basic activities you can do almost anywhere:
<ul>

<h3>Except No Substitutions</h3>
The science on physical activity as a means to improve your health is well known in the medical field. From preventing <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/285701.php?tw"">serious disease</a> to improving your <a href=""http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-10-minutes-benefits-brain.html"">brain health</a>, exercise is an equal and integral component of healthy living along with proper diet. You can’t have one without the other. Fad diets and <a href=""http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/28/5/330"">unproven trends like a ""polypill</a>"" should not be relied upon as a quick fix or substitute for a healthy lifestyle (but may be prescribed by physicians when necessary). To improve cardiovascular health and prevent disease, it’s simple: eat right and get moving. There are no alternatives to exercise. Ultimately, it is up to us to make fitness a priority in our lives.

""We all know that we should be physically active because it’s good for us, but we may not know how good and in how many different ways it can be particularly beneficial,"" says EHE Health Coach Shereé Chambers.

""Better than a pill or fad diet, being physically active can positively affect your life right now — from boosting your energy and mood, decreasing disease risk, and increasing lifespan, to improving your confidence, work performance, and sex life.""

59,"Don-t-Fear-Medical-Screenings","Don’t Fear Medical Screenings","As the saying goes, “knowledge is power.” When it comes to personal health, however, many prefer another adage: “ignorance is bliss.” Visiting the doctor for a medical exam and learning one’s overall health status may stir up thoughts of mortality and guilt for not taking better care of our bodies, especially as we age. This avoidance mindset will not help us make pro-active decisions about our health.

“Avoiding medical tests because of anxiety can cause more health problems, such as fatigue, muscle tension, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping, according to the <a href=""http://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad/symptoms"">Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a>,” writes John Fortunbury in <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/when-health-ignorance-is-bliss/381370/2/"">The Atlantic</a>. “Even if the worry is only an occasional one, [anxiety] weakens the immune system.”
<h2>A Matter of Perspective</h2>
You can turn around fear of seeking and understanding health information by embracing medical screenings and preventive exams as tools to build a plan to get and/or stay healthy. When a doctor conducts a thorough exam and provides the results, you are in command. If you take control over medical information, instead of the other way around, you will not only alleviate anxiety but change your health outcomes.

EHE Physician Dr. Gabriella Trotta-Barni says, “knowledge of certain information, such as cholesterol levels or blood pressure can be empowering; with a change in lifestyle habits, like diet and exercise, one can decrease cardiovascular risk, and feel better in general.”
<h2>It's Just a Test</h2>
In other words, approach medical screenings like taking a test. We all take tests in school to measure where we are and what we’ve learned thus far. A medical screening is no different. There’s no failing grade, and it’s not a prescription for your destiny. Preventive medical screenings are conducted to establish a physical health baseline in order to know what to address and where to make improvements.
""When we avoid preventive tests we take away our greatest weapon in fighting chronic disease,” says psychologist Mike Friedman of EHE’s <a href=""../../../../com/eheintl/www/executive-mgmt-boards.html"">Medical Advisory Board</a>. “We must remember that most diseases are chronic but controllable if we detect them and implement strong health behaviors.""

Even if medical screenings find a problem, catching it in the early stages may prevent an ailment from becoming a chronic disease and/or make it more manageable. Don’t leave your medical condition unresolved. Far from being scary, a proper medical screening is your greatest protection from harm and the best resource for improving your overall health.

60,"DiarrheaThe1-Traveler-s-Health-Issue","Diarrhea: The #1 Traveler's Health Issue","American travelers abroad frequently get sick from eating foods or drinking water because we often have no immunity to local pathogens. If you don’t take certain health precautions, you may eventually pay the consequences. Stomach and digestive problems should not be the price of your visit nor a test of your mettle as a traveler. A night or two spent in a hotel bathroom is no fun, and stomach infections can lead to aggravated health issues, especially for children or individuals with compromised immune systems.

“While you can be adventurous in your travels, try not to be so adventurous in your food choices while in third world countries,” says EHE International travel medicine nurse practitioner Marianne Dyke. “Nobody wants digestive distress while away from home.”

Diarrhea affects 30% to 70% of travelers and is the most <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002433.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">predictable travel-related illness</a>. Your personal health status and travel destination greatly impacts the types of precautions you should take. The exposure potential is relative to the season and destination:
<ul>
 	<li>Low risk: United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Western Europe</li>
 	<li>Intermediate risk: Eastern Europe, South Africa, Caribbean islands</li>
 	<li>High risk: Asia, Middle East, Africa, Mexico, Central and South America</li>
</ul>
<h3>Traveler’s Health Scourge</h3>
Diarrhea is more than inconvenient. Bacteria and viruses may cause severe dehydration and lead to gastrointestinal problems. In extreme cases, infections become acute medical conditions requiring a hospital stay. A doctor may recommend a <a href=""http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-2-the-pre-travel-consultation/travelers-diarrhea"">prophylactic vaccine</a> (such as against Typhoid) if exposure is unavoidable.

Traveler’s diarrhea is common, but many of us don’t know what preventive health measures to take and rely on word-of-mouth or unscientific remedies. Follow a few simple steps in your daily routine:
<ul>
 	<li>Drink only bottled water and beverages</li>
 	<li>Do not eat from street vendors in third world countries</li>
 	<li>Eat well cooked foods or steamed vegetables in restaurants regardless of your location</li>
 	<li>Avoid raw fruit and vegetables</li>
 	<li>Do not use ice in beverages</li>
 	<li>Brush your teeth with bottled water</li>
</ul>
The best advice for avoiding diarrhea is to <a href=""../../../../com/eheintl/www/travelmed.html"">talk with a travel medicine doctor</a>. A doctor trained in preventive health for travelers will help plan your itinerary and provide care specific to your needs. With proper information and smart choices, you will not have to worry about diarrhea—and enjoy your travels.

61,"Preventive-Careampthe-Obesity-Crisis","Preventive Care &amp; the Obesity Crisis","A comprehensive study on America’s growing obesity epidemic has little good news. The research report, <a href=""http://stateofobesity.org/"">State of Obesity</a>, reveals that over 1/3 of Americans are becoming dangerously fatter in every category. The report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and Trust for America’s Health (TFAH) breaks down obesity rates by geography. The population of every state in the union is now over 20% obese, while 20 states top 30%.

<a href=""http://www.stateofobesity.org"" target=""_blank"" data-mce-target=""_blank""><img class=""aligncenter"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/obesityrates.jpgt1488480168246"" alt=""obesityrates"" /></a>

""This is a problem that doesn't have either a single solution or a single cause,"" said Jeffrey Levi, Ph.D., executive director of TFAH, reported in the <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/04/state-obesity-obese-weight_n_5766478.html"">Huffington Post</a>. ""But certainly, over the last 30 years, we've seen a dramatic increase in fast food outlets and our lifestyle changes ... in terms of what we're eating, the quality of what we're eating and where we're eating it, and [decreasing] physical activity levels.""

As Dr. Levi suggests, medical professionals are only beginning to understand the extent of the problem and must grapple with a condition which stretches beyond health issues. How we eat is a complex story.
<h2>Inequality of Obesity</h2>
News reports have picked up on the obesity report’s illustration of <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/04/us-health-obesity-idUSKBN0GZ1D420140904"">the disparities across population groups.</a> Being extremely overweight in America is directly related to where you live, your racial/ethnic background, and income level.

&nbsp;

<a href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/09/04/study-americans-24-pounds-fatter-than-in-1960?int=98e708""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1687"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/racialrates.jpgt1488480168246ampwidth450ampnameracialrates.jpg"" alt=""racial rates"" width=""670"" height=""237"" />
Reporter Lindsey Cook</a> pinpoints a few notable statistics which makes obesity a higher risk for certain groups:
“8 percent of blacks live in a <a href=""https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_ct.html"">census tract</a> with a supermarket, compared with 31 percent of whites. A whopping 23.5 million of Americans don't live within a mile of a supermarket. This is important because research has shown blacks with a supermarket in their neighborhood consume 32 percent more fruits and vegetables.”

With whole communities unable to access grocery stores for nutritious foods, people rely on fat-filled convenience store snacks for their primary meals.
<h2>Systemic Malnutrition</h2>
Kelly D. Brownell and Katherine Battle Horgen, authors of Food Fight: The Inside Story of the Food Industry, puts the blame squarely on a ""toxic food environment” created in modern America. June Stevens sums the basic claims of <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/1/239.2.full"">Food Fight</a>:
<div></div>
<div>“Simply stated, increased food consumption means increased profits—but increased food consumption is not consistent with the health needs of our over-nourished population. The authors expose the role of corporations that sell foods that contribute to the obesity epidemic, but they stop short of painting the food companies as nefarious villains.”</div>
Essentially, industrial food production and distribution makes it difficult for many of us to eat healthy, regardless of our food choices.
<h2>Baked in the Genes</h2>
<a href=""http://consumer.healthday.com/kids-health-information-23/child-development-news-124/appetite-genes-might-be-key-to-childhood-obesity-684963.html"">Recent British studies</a> have found some infants are born with greater appetites and, thus, a predisposition towards weight gain.

""Appetite is key and it would be sensible for parents to keep an eye on children who appear to be responding to food a lot more avidly than their peers,"" said Clare Llewellyn a researcher at the University College London. ""Those who have inherited genes that make them feel less full are more likely to overeat and gain weight.""

If you don’t have the natural mental and physical triggers to stop eating, you may easily develop eating behaviors that lead to chronic obesity.
<h2>Expanding Waistlines &amp; Wallets</h2>
Obesity takes an enormous toll on one’s personal health and longevity, medical professionals warn. The <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2012/08/16/what-the-obesity-epidemic-costs-us-infographic"">financial costs </a>of a heavier and unhealthy American public should not be overlooked:
<ul>
 	<li>$160 Billion increase in medical expenses</li>
 	<li>$938 Billion increase in fuel costs from passenger weight</li>
 	<li>$7.5 Billion increase in clothing expenses for bigger sizes</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
Obesity has complicated healthcare, environmental, genetic and socio-economic factors. Preventive health measures to address obesity can only go so far given the surrounding thicket of social issues and policy decisions. Reducing excessive weight gain is no longer a simple dinner plate choice.

However, this doesn’t mean you should give up on diet and exercise or fall into despair if you are struggling with obesity. You can take a first step by visiting a doctor with expertise in preventive care. By fully assessing your medical condition, a physician will develop a solid nutrition and exercise plan to fit your lifestyle and your goals.

Serious infections may lead to cancer if not caught early and treated. Council Speaker <a href=""http://council.nyc.gov/d8/html/members/home.shtml"">Melissa Mark-Viverito</a> announced the surprising diagnosis on her Twitter account:

<img class=""aligncenter"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tweetspeaker.jpgt1488480168246"" alt=""tweetspeaker"" />

Like many of us who live busy lives, the Speaker overlooked her own personal health and skipped regular check-ups with a doctor. <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/prevention.htm"">Medical experts recommend</a> women receive PAP tests every 3 years beginning at age 21, and be screened for HPV at age 30. Because signs are not always visible, most women who have <a href=""http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/human-papillomavirus.html#f"">HPV infections never know it</a>. Visit a gynecologist at least once a year for check-ups regardless of your sexual activity or age, and follow your doctor’s recommendations regarding frequency of HPV screenings.

All men and women should be evaluated for HPV vaccination eligibility during preventive health exams or with a primary care physician. Results from <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/HPV/index.html"">studies demonstrate</a> that the HPV vaccine is effective in reducing infections; however, as EHE physician Dr. Seema Sarin notes:

“The HPV vaccine is not perfectly protective, meaning that some men and women will acquire an HPV infection despite having being vaccinated. The vaccine does not prevent other sexually-transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Thus, it is important to always practice safer sex to reduce the risk of all sexually-transmitted diseases.”

Speaker Mark-Viverito, who is 45, plans to use her personal medical struggle to raise awareness about HPV:

<img class=""aligncenter"" src=""https://eheintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tweet_viverito.jpgt1488480168246"" alt=""tweet_viverito"" />
Some people feel uncomfortable discussing sexually-transmitted diseases and, therefore, do not request medical screenings.

""Presumably the stigma of sexually transmitted diseases occurs to discourage unsafe sexual behavior,” says psychologist <a href=""http://michaelfriedmanphd.com/"">Dr. Mike Friedman</a>. “But for many it actually discourages testing and responsible preventive behavior. We need to find a way to encourage safe sex without discouraging testing.""

Melissa Mark-Viverito’s openness about her HPV screening and treatment has already inspired at least one person to be pro-active with her health. Responding to the Speaker’s announcement, a follower was reminded of the importance of regular preventive exams:

“I haven't seen a GYN in like 5 years. You just inspired me,” <a href=""http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140818/east-harlem/council-speaker-melissa-mark-viverito-reveals-on-twitter-she-has-hpv"">she tweeted</a>. “We need to take care of ourselves so we can take care of others.""

People are understandably distraught over a popular figure dying by his own hand.

Robin was a performer bursting with vitality; sadness to the point of suicide didn’t appear to be in his DNA.

Although he has opened up about his <a href=""http://news.sky.com/story/1317105/robin-williams-career-haunted-by-addiction"">alcohol and drug addiction</a> over the years, Robin’s manic performance style left audiences with an impression his life was perhaps over-flowing at times but not depressed.

Robin Williams’s death is a reminder of our misperceptions about clinical depression and its severity.

Depression is the most prominent mental disorder and a major national health risk, affecting nearly <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/statistics/1MDD_ADULT.shtml"">16 million Americans</a> at some point in their lives. “But despite how common the illness is,” reports Karen Rowan of <a href=""https://news.yahoo.com/robin-williams-death-difference-between-depression-normal-sadness-012550678.html"">Yahoo News</a>, “many people do not understand exactly what it means to have depression, and often think of it as being the same as sadness.” Mental health professionals define <a href=""http://www.nami.org/template.cfm?section=Depression"">clinical depression</a> as a severe mental state that doesn’t go away with time and places the sufferer’s physical health in danger.

Mental illness takes a toll on the body. “Depression is a prevalent and chronic mental disorder causing suffering, loss of function and loss of life,” says psychologist Dr. Mike Friedman, medical advisory board member at EHE International. Dr. Friedman further explains on his <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brick-brick/201402/why-happier-doesn-t-necessarily-mean-healthier"">Psychology Today blog</a>:
<div>

“Depression is associated with reduced heart rate variability, platelet aggregation and increased sympathetic nervous system activity, all of which increase risks for patients with cardiac disease. Further, depressed individuals often have reduced energy and lower motivation, which interferes with activities like exercise, buying and preparing healthy foods, and attending medical appointments, all of which are critical for restoring heart health.”

Robin’s death tragically demonstrates the greatest threat. “Suicide is a common symptom of severe, clinical depression,” explains Dr. John M. Grohol on <a href=""http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2014/08/11/robin-williams-bipolar-sufferer-dead-at-63-due-to-suicide/"">his blog</a>. “When properly treated, the feelings of suicide often remit as the depression lifts. But even under treatment, sometimes people choose to take their own life.”

Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., but Robin’s fate is not the inevitable result of depression. Mental illness has warning signs, knowable health risk factors, and available treatment options. ""But there are barriers that need to be overcome to adequately address depression,"" notes Dr. Friedman in a <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/13/opinion/friedman-robin-williams/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CNN.com op-ed</a>. ""First and foremost, the stigma of depression is making us sicker."" May the great funnyman’s loss serve to enlighten us about the reality of depression and help us to recognize and treat it early.

64,"Evaluating-Your-Health-Risk-Is-a-Conv","Evaluating Your Health Risk Is a Conversation","A thorough examination and comprehensive set of preventive health screenings by medical experts will produce valuable data for your doctor; however, health care isn’t all a numbers game. Talk with your doctor to fully understand what the data charts mean in real-life terms to you. This is particularly critical when making medical or lifestyle decisions based on risk factors—whether to change your diet, go on medications, or have major surgery. Prevention is founded upon a dialogue where patients are active partners with doctors in developing their care.
<h3><strong>What to Expect from a Risk Assessment </strong></h3>
As the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/healthy_eating/fruits_vegetables.html?s_cid=tw_ob825"">CDC advises</a>, only trained doctors should perform examinations and evaluate your health status and risks. Provide your physician with as much information as possible about your current health issues (including any medical conditions or prescriptions), past health problems (even if no longer present), and family members’ health status (e.g., history of diabetes, breast cancer, or heart attacks). Your doctor should be very inquisitive, ask follow-up questions, and request previous medical records if needed.

A preventive health risk assessment should include a full physical examination, biometric screenings, blood draw, EKG, and other tests appropriate for your age, gender, and physical condition. A physician needs various types of information to create a complete picture of your physical condition. Based on established preventive health guidelines, this is what a sound examination looks like:

<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/EYDVUIQl2dg"" width=""853"" height=""480"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>
<h3>Be a Smart Health Information Consumer</h3>
Although you may feel uncomfortable talking about health issues, an open conversation with your doctor will help build a plan to protect your future health. There is no one-size-fits-all way to explain health risk. For instance, some people prefer percentage break downs (e.g., 10% chance of developing colon cancer), but this may not be right for you. Furthermore, a <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/07/24/333719559/for-better-treatment-doctors-and-patients-share-the-decisions"">Massachusetts General Hospital study</a> found “only about 20 percent of the physicians said they were very comfortable using numbers and explaining probabilities to patients."" Whether your doctor provides numerical specifics or speaks in a broad sense, you should ask questions, bring up concerns, and collaborate with your doctor in making lifestyle changes to lower your health risk.
<div></div>
Prior to a doctor visit, make a list of questions and concerns no matter how insignificant.

“Having some sort of written guidance can be very helpful,” notes EHE preventive health physician Dr. Gabriella Trotta-Barni. “Patients may become flustered and feel intimidated once they sit down with a doctor.”

Here is a helpful <a href=""http://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/communicating_with_your_doctor/"">checklist for talking with your doctor</a>. Clear communication is the key to understanding your health risk and taking action.

CVS’s bold announcement (relinquishing nearly $2 billion in sales) may not effect whether someone takes their first puff or their last.

Yet, when a national pharmacy and wellness retailer stops selling a product known to cause preventable diseases to its customers, there’s an implicit preventive health message.

The health hazards of smoking are well documented (EHE first raised the <a href=""http://digitaleditions.walsworthprintgroup.com/publication/?i=156215"">alarm in 1939</a>), and the benefits of quitting – no matter your age or when you stop – are undeniable. After the first 24 hours of quitting, for instance, a smoker’s chance of a heart attack decreases. But this knowledge doesn’t make quitting any easier.

The best way to stop smoking is to never start or quit as early as possible. We all struggle with forecasting risks when we make decisions about our health. Many smokers will tell you this is critical.

Recently, Star Trek Actor <a href=""http://celebrity.yahoo.com/blogs/celeb-news/leonard-nimoy-reveals-he-has-copd--warns-against-smoking-223318587.html"">Leonard Nimoy announced</a> that he is suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) brought on by smoking. Fans became concerned when photographs of him with an oxygen tank surfaced.

As Mr. Nimoy soberly demonstrates, prevention is a mind-set we need to get into early. Thinking preventively may help as us navigate the array of health decisions we face every day. Smoking, in particular, is a behavior that can profoundly impact your health later in life.

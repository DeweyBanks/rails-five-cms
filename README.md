# EHE.health Corporate Site

This project was developed for EHE in late 2017, early 2018 as part of rebuilding the corporate website as a Rails CMS.  It was adapted from the previous website which had been built on Wordpress.

## Local Deployment

Set up your local database and configure the settings in database.yml.  Then run the typical Rails commands to get started:

```bash
bundle install
yarn install
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
rails s
```

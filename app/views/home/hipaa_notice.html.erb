        <h3 class="drkr-gray-text">Notice of Privacy Practices</h3>
        <p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) was enacted by Congress in 1996. HIPAA included what are called “Administrative Simplification” provisions that required the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to adopt national standards for electronic health care transactions, such as health care claims that are filed electronically. Because advances in electronic technology could make it difficult to protect the privacy of health information, Congress mandated the adoption of the HIPAA Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (“Privacy Rule” or “Rule”). Congress subsequently enacted the HIPAA Security Rule and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.</p>
        <p>All of these laws impact our use and disclosure of patient information.</p>
        <p>EHE International is required by law to provide you with this notice of privacy practices in order to  inform you of h ow our organization may use and disclose your protected health information (PHI), to explain your rights and responsibilities with respect to your PHI and to detail our duties with respect to your PHI. Please review carefully.</p>

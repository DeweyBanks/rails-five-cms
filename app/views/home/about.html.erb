                <p>EHE was founded in 1913 as the first care provider dedicated to giving healthy people the lifestyle guidance to be even healthier. It was an unprecedented approach, and the results were dynamic from the start. President Woodrow Wilson endorsed our diet, tens of thousands of preventive exams were conducted in just the first few years, and EHE began to change generations of lives.</p>
                <p>After inventing preventive care, EHE spent decades evolving it. We have led the way in embracing new tools and expanding expectations for what personal, holistic care can achieve. Medicine changed, and we always stayed on the forefront, giving patients personal attention and the best resources to live their healthiest lives.</p>

              <p>Our story is one of constant innovation, paired with unmatched experience. It's a formula that has made us healthcare leaders for more than 100 years.</p>
              <p>We're excited about where we're going. New technologies and deeper insights are giving us more opportunities than ever to help individuals get what they need to live differently and feel their best, every day.</p>
              <p>EHE has always helped people see their health differently. It's how we continue to build on our groundbreaking legacy. After a century of excellence, our story is only starting.</p>
